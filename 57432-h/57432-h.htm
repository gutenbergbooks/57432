<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The days of miraculous achievements are not past, as
the accounts chronicled in this book will testify. Four
people make a missionary trip from Los Angeles, Cal.,
down the coast of Mexico, preaching in many of her
towns while the ship discharges or loads cargo. They
arrive in Nicaragua and preach to the natives, seeing
numbers of them baptized in the Holy Spirit. Returning
to the States by way of the Panama Canal, and
New Orleans, they reach St. Louis and Granite City,
having been gone less than two years.</p>

<p>Without missionary board, or other promised support
whatever, the Lord provided some $3,000.00 for the trip.
It is a testimony to His faithfulness, a sample of what
He can and will do for those who will put their trust in
Him. Some might question the wisdom and value of
the shortness of their stay, but they moved under Divine
direction. If any possible critic had accompanied them
in their journeyings, and seen the fire in the hearts of
those native people there would have been no doubt in
their minds as to the exceeding profitableness of the
journey in the advancement of the kingdom of God.
Many remote and scattered people were reached.
Praise God! They will be seen in Heaven because of
the Gospel message which they heard.</p>

<p>Then, too, this sketch of many happenings will, we
trust, kindle a flame of missionary fire in many hearts,
and give them a sense of the great need of these Central
American republics, so that they, too, will have to go,
pray, or give. Brother, Sister, have you not some
responsibility toward sending the Gospel to those benighted
people so long neglected? Let us not share in
the great age-long crime of the church in her neglect of
the heathen. Do not pass the time in mere happy
dreams of spiritual blessings while the procession of
your lost brethren of other nations tramps on into
eternity with no Christ. Be not like drones, who eat
the honey but do nothing for the advancement of the
kingdom.</p>

<h2 id="A_MESSAGE_GIVEN_TO_ME_IN_TONGUES">A MESSAGE GIVEN TO ME IN TONGUES
WITH INTERPRETATION,
March 15, 1919</h2>

<p><b>It was on this message from the Lord
that we went to the mission field by faith,
without any earthly board behind us, knowing
that what God had promised He would
perform.</b></p>

<p>“The time has come when I will send thee forth. Arise!
put away all doubt and say to the dark clouds, ‘Depart
from before my face!’ and to all fear that may arise to
stop you from following in the way that I shall lead thee,
‘Flee ye, far from me, to return no more! for the Lord
my God hath spoken, and I shall not be dismayed nor
put to shame!’</p>

<p>“Begin this day to prepare to go forth, for I will send
thee unto the land to which I have called thee, and
every need shall be supplied.</p>

<p>“Only be strong and of good courage, for My left
hand is under thy head, and My right hand doth embrace
thee. Thou shalt sit down under My shadow with great
delight, and My fruit shall be sweet to thy taste. I will
plant thee in a fruitful land, and thou shalt bring forth
fruit in My name, some thirty, some sixty, and some an
hundred fold. Do not fear to go forth in My name, for
I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward. I Am
that I Am hath spoken unto thee this day, and I AM
THAT I AM will go before thee.</p>

<p>“Thou shalt see of the travail of thy soul, and shall
be satisfied, for thou shalt see many that sit in darkness
and the shadow of death see the light of My glory, and
come to praise My name. For from the rising of the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
even unto the going down of the same, My name shall
be great among all nations.”</p>

<h2 id="PREPARING_TO_START">PREPARING TO START</h2>

<p>After receiving the wonderful message in
tongues, with its interpretation, telling us the
time had come for us to make ready to go to the
mission field, we began packing our trunks,
putting away the things which we would not
need during the summer. We had been working
in a hard field that winter, the income had been
very small, and poor husband had worked as
much as possible, to get the children clothes
and books for school. But work was scarce and
the battle had been long and hard, for we felt
we must settle down again that the children
might be in school, which matter the Lord had
dealt with us about many times before.</p>

<p>We were preparing to start as soon as the way
was opened, when there came a letter from a
brother asking if we would not come and have
some meetings with them. We felt led to go,
and on arriving found the revival spirit was in
the air. The first night the place was packed,
and the altar was filled with hungry people seeking
the Lord. We were there three weeks, and
they certainly were blessed weeks of victory, for
many precious souls received the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit and many were healed, and the
Lord sent in money for some clothing, which we
were all needing badly.</p>

<p>After the meeting we returned for our trunks
and to prepare for the trip across the country
to California, for from there we were to sail for
our field in Central America.</p>

<h2 id="HOME_LEAVING">HOME LEAVING</h2>

<p>Bidding our loved ones good-bye we left
Granite City, Illinois, May 29th, 1919. We
took train from St. Louis at 4 P. M., for Stanton,
Missouri, where God had definitely led us to go.</p>

<p>As the train sped out of the city and over the
long stretch of country beyond, I was meditating
over the many things that had happened at
our farewell. My dear mother had said she did
not understand this thing, and my brothers and
sisters had spoken against our going out in such
a foolish way, without money and without backing
of any kind. They just knew that we would
all starve and die in that far-off country. None
of them being Christians, they could not understand
how the dear Lord could supply our every
need. But the blessed Holy Spirit had spoken
to my heart and said, “You have left all, brothers,
sisters, father, mother, houses and lands for
My sake, and the Gospel’s, so I will give you
brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers, houses
and lands, wherever you go.”</p>

<p>As we rode on, we were praying that God
would lead us every step of the way, and not let
us miss His will in any thing we did or said. As
I took some tracts from my hand bag to distribute
among the passengers I noticed a white-haired
gentleman take a seat just across from
us. The Spirit said to me, “That is one of your
Pentecostal brothers. Ask him what you want
to know about the place to which you are
going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>We were not acquainted with any one at
Stanton, and had been wishing that we could
find out something about the place and the
people before we arrived. I began distributing
the tracts through the car, and when I came to
this man he looked up and said, “<b>Praise the
Lord!</b>” We had a blessed time from there on,
talking of the work over the country, and
learning of conditions at Stanton.</p>

<p>Arriving at the station we bade our brother
good-bye and got off the train. It was now
quite dark, and raining, and our funds were
down to twenty cents. We stopped under the
shed of the depot long enough to pray for leadings
from the Lord, for it was late, the agent had
gone, the depot was closed and the brother had
told us that he thought most of the saints lived
out in the country. As we looked to our
Heavenly Father to guide us He directed us to
a store on the hill. The owner was just closing
the door as we came up. My husband asked
him if any of the mission people lived in the town
and he said he did not know. As we passed
down the street we heard some one say, “<b>Well,
‘Praise the Lord!’</b> Where did you come from?”
It was dear brother Armstead. We had met
him and his wife in some meetings in St. Louis,
but did not know they lived in Stanton. Also
others were there whom we knew, having met
them in other places. We stayed about ten
days and had blessed meetings. The blessing
of the Lord came down upon our souls, the dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
little band of faithful saints were refreshed, and
the altar was filled with those seeking the Lord.</p>

<p>A remarkable incident occurred here. A
woman across the street from where we were
having the meetings became very much incensed
at us because she thought we prayed and
sang too loud. She sent her children over to
throw rocks and sticks at us, while she sat in
her house and made light of the shouting. One
night the power fell in a wonderful way and the
people were very happy. This woman was sitting
barefoot in her bedroom reading the evening
paper, and felt something cold touch her
foot, but did not give it any attention at first.
Feeling it again she looked down, and there was
a very large snake coiled ready to strike her
foot. She sprang away and screamed, then ran
to the meeting crying for some one to come and
kill the snake, as it had gotten on the bed where
the baby was asleep. Some of the brothers went
over, found the serpent on the bed, and killed it.
After that the woman felt different toward us
and our shouting and praising the Lord. We
had been praying for her and the Lord had told
us He would take care of it all. We find the
Lord uses different means to bring people to
Himself.</p>

<p>From Stanton we went to Rolla, Missouri.
We knew no one in Rolla, or anything about
the place, but the Lord had told us to go there,
so we went. We just had money enough to get
there. As we stepped off the train a brother
threw his arms around my husband and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
“<b>Well, Hallelujah!</b> My wife told me to come
and meet this train, for the Lord was sending
some one on it to help us in the meetings we
have just started, and here you are, just in
time.” They had opened a little work there
and had been asking the Lord to send someone
to help them, so He had sent us, bless His dear
Name! He also sent the Holy Spirit, for we had
a wonderful time. One of the hard fighters of
Pentecost received the Baptism, and many
others were blessed in their souls, and some were
healed in their bodies.</p>

<p>From Rolla we went to Springfield, Missouri,
and stayed over Sunday with the dear saints
there, having a refreshing time for our souls, and
a rest for our bodies. From there we went to
Everton, Missouri, where we had been led to
hold some meetings.</p>

<p>On arriving in this little town we found that
the only building there was for the meetings had
burned down the day before. We spent the
day in a grocery store praying for a door to be
opened for the Gospel, for we had been told it
was a very wicked town and that the Pentecostal
message had never been preached there.</p>

<p>In the evening we went out to see about getting
some rooms where we could stay while
there. Going to a certain place we met the
Presbyterian minister. When he found that
we had come to have revival meetings he hastened
to open his church to us and insisted that
we begin the services that night. He told us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that he had been praying for a revival as
they had not had a convert in that town for
over thirty years, and that he hoped we could
do something to stir the people up. He had not
asked us what we were preaching, as many others
do when we arrive in a new place. If he had
known how we would stir up things in that dead
town and that fine Presbyterian church I don’t
know whether he would have been so quick to
invite us in.</p>

<p>He rang the church bell, we went in and began
to sing and pray, and soon the crowd came.
Such a hungry-looking lot of people they were,
yet they looked like they were ready to run if
something happened that they did not understand.
As we prayed and testified the glory
settled down over us. Each night the people
moved up a little closer to the fire, and some
dared to come up in the rostrum and help us
sing. Once in a while we heard a faint Amen
from the dear old pastor, and one night, after
the Lord had met us in a very sweet and wonderful
way, he came and said, “There is something
so different about you people from what we
have ever seen in others. Why,” said he, “it is
no trouble at all for you to pray and testify,
and there is something about these meetings
that fills my heart with joy, and I want you to
pray that I will get this blessing that you have,
for we need a great spiritual awakening here.”</p>

<p>I felt like jumping up and down and telling
him we had the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and
it was that which made us different from other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
folks. <b>O Hallelujah!</b> But I knew we must
use wisdom with them, so left it to the Lord to
work out in His own way and time.</p>

<p>The next night the power fell on Sister Hagg,
and she went up and down the platform singing
in the Spirit and speaking in tongues. We were
wonderfully anointed and had a blessed meeting.
The dear people had never seen anything like
that before. They looked so hungry.</p>

<p>The next morning the pastor and his wife
came to our rooms and he said, “I want this
blessed experience. Pray for me, and pray for
my wife’s healing.” She was deaf. We had a
sweet time praying together, the dear old pastor
calling on God to send the Holy Spirit into his
life and into the church.</p>

<p>The next day we had to move on to Kansas
City. But I am sure there was a work done
and seed sown in Everton that will bring forth
fruit. The people came to bid us good-bye,
saying they were so glad we had come and
brought them the light of Pentecost.</p>

<p>At the depot we were told the price of our
tickets was $20. We found we were short of
that amount by $4.20. We had only $14.80.
We went aside and prayed, telling the Lord He
had told us to go to Kansas City, Missouri, and
now the train was arriving and we did not have
sufficient money. The Lord said, “Go to the
window and call for the tickets.” We obeyed,
knowing the Lord was able to send money right
straight from Heaven. As husband received the
tickets through the window, the agent said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
“$14.80.” We were soon on the train speeding
on our way. We do not know just how it came
about, but we know God did it. <b>Hallelujah!</b>
He makes a way where there is no way, if we
believe.</p>

<p>It was after dark when we arrived in Kansas
City. We prayed and asked the Lord just
where He wanted us to go as we did not know
anyone there. He directed us straight up a
street. We walked several blocks, not knowing
where there were any missions. We saw a nice
little brick church on a corner, but no sign to
tell about meetings, and the doors were closed.
As we stood there praying, the Lord told me to
open the door and go in.</p>

<p>As we pushed on the door it opened into a vestibule.
From there some steps led into the auditorium
through another door. We heard some
one saying, “<b>Praise the Lord!</b>” and knew they
must be Pentecostal people. A brother came with
outstretched hands to greet us, asking, “Where
did you come from?” It was dear Brother
Huff from Chicago, who was in charge of the
mission. We had a blessed time together praising
God and seeing souls brought in and baptized
in the Spirit. We were also blessed with
Brother Scott in the mission in Kansas City,
Kansas, and with his saints.</p>

<p>We then went on to Topeka, Kansas, by the
direction of the Lord. We never went anywhere
until we had prayed and received instructions
from the Lord. Most of the time He spoke
through my lips the name of the next place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
even telling us when to go, and what train to
take. Oh, the blessedness of the sweet Holy
Spirit flowing in and upon our souls till we are
lost in Him.</p>

<p class="center"><b>“He leadeth me, oh, blessed thought.”</b></p>

<p>We arrived in Topeka, knowing nothing of
the missions there or how to find them. As we
were walking down a street the Lord said, “Ask
that boy where the mission is.” He was the
son of one of the saints, and lived near the
mission. We were at that mission two weeks
and had a precious time.</p>

<p>The Lord provided for us to travel to Colorado
Springs with Sister Bowers in her car.
Many were the times and ways God showed His
mighty arm out-stretched toward us. We started
with very little money to buy food and gasoline,
or to pay for repairs for the car. But He provided
for all.</p>

<p>One morning as we were crossing a bridge,
some drunken men ran their car into ours,
throwing it over the edge of the bridge which
had no rail, the bridge being a new one and
not completed. Our machine hung out over the
water fifty feet below. But as we went over
the edge the power came upon us all, and we
began speaking in tongues. The glory of God
came down like a great white cloud, and the
machine was picked up and set in the middle of
the bridge without a scratch on us or on it.</p>

<p>Another time when we came into a town we
were told that the road ahead was impassable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that twenty cars had been pulled out of the
place where the water covered the road for
about a mile. We asked the Lord if we should go
on or not. He said we should go on, and if we
believed we should see the glory of God. As we
approached the water, which came up to the
doors of the machine, and with great ditches
on either side, filled with water, we could not
see where the road was, nor where the ditches
were. The power came down over the machine,
and we all began to sing in tongues. Sister
Bowers’ hands went up in the air, and never
touched the wheel till we were over the place,
about a mile in length. The mud and water
did not even splash the wind shield or machine
anywhere.</p>

<p><b>“We will rejoice in Thy salvation, and in
the name of God we will set up our banners.
The Lord fulfil all thy petitions.”</b>—Psalm
20:5.</p>

<p>We stopped at several places on the way and
held meetings. We also gave out tracts and
papers, filling the rural mail boxes along the
highways with gospel literature. Each morning
we cooked our breakfast and had our morning
worship by the roadside, then went on our way
praising God for all His goodness in permitting
us to preach His glorious gospel.</p>

<p>One night when we were sleeping out on the
open prairie—as we were too heavily loaded
to carry a tent—there came up a terrible storm.
The wind blew at a terrific gale and the thunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and lightning were awful. We were fast asleep
when a large coyote came near and began his
loud barking, evidently sent by the Lord to
awaken us just in time to see our clothes and
hats sweeping across the plain before the fierce
wind. We ran after them, and prayed the Lord
to stop the storm, telling Him He had promised
us that it should not rain on us. Then the wind
stopped, also the thunder and lightning, and we
had nice dry weather the rest of the way.</p>

<p>Arriving in Colorado Springs, we were welcomed
by the dear pastor and people. They
had a nice assembly, and the Lord sweetly
worked the few days we were there.</p>

<p>Some people from the plains came asking us
to come and hold meetings for them in a school-house.
They had never heard Pentecost
preached, excepting one woman who had read
some about it and was hungry for the Baptism.
We found the whole country Free Methodist,
and they said they had the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>We had meetings every night for about a week,
everybody sitting back and looking on. On
Sunday we were invited to the home of some of
the leading people for dinner. After we had
eaten, someone went to the piano and began
playing a hymn, and we started to sing. Soon
we heard a terrible noise. Looking around we
saw the man of the house laid out in the middle
of the floor, shaking from head to foot under the
power of God. In fact his feet were up in the air
and his whole body was shaking violently. His
wife and the people were running out after water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to throw on him. But we told them it was the
power of God, and they must leave him alone.
They declared he had a spell with his heart and
was dying, but we kept on singing and holding
on in prayer till he came through.</p>

<p>The news spread all over the country, and
that night all the rigs and autos for many miles
around were there bringing the people to see the
strange sights. While we were singing, the
daughter of this same man arose, came to the
altar and fell under the power. The fire spread
over the house, God working in a wondrous way.
Some said it was the power of God, others said
we were hypnotizing the people, and that was
what made them fall. The whole country was
stirred, and many heard the last-day message
of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit to prepare
the people for the coming of the Lord. We
still receive letters from these people. They
are holding on to God, and He is blessing them.</p>

<p>We also visited with dear Brother and Sister
Roper and their sister Stout, at Immanuel Faith
Home, in Pueblo. This is a school for orphan
children, and a faith home where saints and
missionaries can come and rest for a while. We
were there for a week, and those were days of
great blessing and refreshings from the Lord.
These clear saints have opened that wonderful
work in faith, looking to God to supply every
need, and surely He has done according to His
promise. The way we saw God work there in
answering prayer was far beyond anything we
had ever witnessed before, and the way the dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
little children were taught to pray and trust
God for their needs was blessed.</p>

<p>From there we went in the machine to Denver,
where we spent two weeks at the camp-meeting.
How the blessing of the Lord did come down on
our souls! We were greatly refreshed and our
faith was quickened. The latter was needed, for
we were going to the mission field by faith,
looking to the Lord alone to supply every need.</p>

<p>The camp-meeting was coming to a close and
the tents were being taken down, but we did not
know where we were to go next. As I was packing
the suit-cases, and getting ready to leave, the
Lord said to me, “Arrange your clothes, for you
will go to Los Angeles in a few days.”</p>

<p>Offerings had been small and expenses heavy,
so we had but little money, therefore we did not
see how we could get to Los Angeles. But
never mind. “The natural man receiveth not
the things of God.” Don’t reason, but believe.
As I walked out by the lake, and saw the pretty
little fish so at home in the beautiful water,
without a care, for God took care of them, He
spoke to my heart, and said, “Not a worry, for
as I made this beautiful crystal lake for the
fish, so I have made a great and beautiful way
for My children. And just as the fish swim
through the water and drink it, so My little
children shall live and move in Me.” “For in
Him we live and move and have our being.”</p>

<p>Just then three women came up in a machine
and stopped near where I was. All were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
strangers to me, but the Spirit said, “Join yourself
to them.” I went over and spoke to them,
asking if they were Christians. They said they
were, and were wanting to see me. They had
heard me speak the night before, and wanted to
see more of me. When I bade them good-bye
one of them went with me to my tent. She
said she had some of the Lord’s money for me,
but did not know how to find me, as the camp
was breaking up and everyone was going away,
but she had been directed back to the camp-ground.
“Give me your address on the mission
field,” she said, “as I am to help support you
there.” Besides what she gave me at the camp-meeting,
she was one of our main supports on
the field, sending her offerings in no small sums.</p>

<p>We then went to Colorado Springs with a
brother in his auto. All the way the Lord kept
saying to me, “You will leave for Los Angeles
soon after arriving at the Springs.” As we
must have $100.00 more for our tickets, we did
not know how it was going to work out. When
we went to the post office we received a letter
from a brother in Kansas with a check for
$100.00. In the letter he said, “I supposed you
were in California, but as I was writing this
check I was led to send it to Colorado Springs.
Hope you receive it o. k.” So here was the rest
of our fare. Just as God had said, we were to
go to California. He had the money right on
hand, bless His name! After buying our tickets
and a little lunch, we had $3 left. We praised
the Lord we were on our way to the mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
field, to tell the heathen of this wonderful salvation.</p>

<p>As the train pulled out of the station, a little
sister who had been very kind to us threw $4 in
at the window.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CHURCH_IN_UNITY">THE CHURCH IN UNITY<br />
<span class="smaller">The Wonderful Vision</span></h2>

<p>We passed through Royal Gorge, and over
the mountains, reaching the highest point just
as the sun was sinking behind the western hills.</p>

<p>They call it “The Top of the World.” There
is a post office there where tourists mail folders
and cards to all parts of the country, describing
the beautiful scenery. Here is the Arkansas
River, dividing at an elevation of 10,000 feet,
running two ways, growing wider and wider as it
flows down the mountain beside the railroad.
I sat looking out the window at the stream which
waters the fields all along the sides of the mountains
and in the valleys. The water is conducted
through great flumes running in all directions,
even carrying the water up hill in some places.</p>

<p>The scene faded before my eyes, and in its
place I saw a great desert, O, so big and barren!
There was nothing but bits of thorny cactus
growing here and there. The sand was dry
and parched. Far out in the middle of the
desert there was an old house. It was only a
shack. The roof boards were so old and
weather beaten they were curling up at the ends.
The sides were beginning to fall away from the
roof. The door was small and falling off the
hinges. There seemed not one ray of hope for
the little old shack so far away in the desert.
The winds of many centuries had beaten upon
its sides. It was ready to fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>As I looked far away on every side I saw
nothing but hot dry sand. Over the sand came
a man. He was weary, and the hot sun beat
fiercely upon his bare head. As he came nearer
I saw he was reading a Bible. He was so interested
in it that he looked not to the right or left.
His face was right down in the Book. Behind
him came another, and still another, until there
was a great company of people, thousands of
them, both men and women. All had their
faces buried in the Bible. They were entering
the little old shack, passing in one by one. I
wondered at so many people being able to get
into so small a house. But soon I discovered
that the house was enlarging. The door became
new and swung upright on new hinges.</p>

<p>As far as I could see across the plain people
were coming. Each one’s face was down in the
Word of God. They were all moving toward
and into the house, now no longer a dilapidated
shack but becoming a great strong building.
The roof was now of new material, of such a
bright red color that my eyes could not look upon
it. The sides had become new. From the door
clear water was beginning to flow. I could see
the sands of the desert carried before it as it
went down and out of the building. Then the
water burst forth from all sides of the house,
till all but the roof was clear, crystal water.</p>

<p>The water spread over the desert, until it had
become a mighty river covering the whole
country, and people of every nation came running
to it. The great house in the center was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of such beauty that my eyes could not look upon
it. The people began to come out of the house,
but they were not the same as when they went
into it. They were now large men and women,
as tall as telephone poles. Their countenances
were shining with the glory of God. In their
hands were large nets. These they cast into the
stream, in which there were many fish, for as the
people of all nations ran and fell into the water
they became fish. I could see their tails as they
swam about. Each net was brought up full of
fine, large fish.</p>

<p>Over the top of the building was written in
letters of fire, “THE CHURCH IN UNITY.”
As the vision disappeared, I realized I was still
on the train. Having my Bible in my hand I
opened to this Scripture, “DECLARE HIS
GLORY AMONG THE HEATHEN, <b>HIS
MARVELLOUS WORKS AMONG ALL
NATIONS</b>.” I Chron. 16:24.</p>

<p>Then the Lord showed me that when His
people receive, through the Holy Spirit, the
revelation of the Word, they will come together
in unity; not merely be brought together by
some creed or doctrine, but by the revelation of
the scriptures, as they are made Spirit and life.
This will cause the dilapidated building, which
represents the church out in the desert of unbelief
and false doctrine, to become new, strong
and great, with the waters of the Spirit flowing
out to all nations. And just as the Arkansas
River, rising at the mountain summit, divided
and ran both ways, watering the fields on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
side of the mountain, so as the church reaches
the mountain summit of God’s love and revelation
of the scriptures, the waters of salvation
will flow both ways, to the home and also to
the foreign field, and there will be a Heaven-taught
and Spirit-trained ministry of apostles,
prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers, for
the perfecting of the saints, and for the evangelization
of the heathen.</p>

<h2 id="OPENING_THE_WAY">OPENING THE WAY.</h2>

<p>Arriving in Salt Lake City at noon the next
day, we were told the train we should take for
Los Angeles did not carry chair cars, so we
would have to wait for a train that left at midnight.
We were very tired from our long train
ride and went aside in the station to rest. I lay
down on a couch in the ladies’ rest room, but
just as I had settled down for rest the Lord said
to me, “Go and buy your berth on this train,
for it will be the last train through.” I did not
know what it meant, but I did not doubt the
voice of God that had spoken to me so many
times in the fifteen years I have been saved.</p>

<p>I went to my husband and told him, and
together we went to the Pullman ticket office.
The agent said, “I have not a berth left. The
train is full and leaves in fifteen minutes.” I
told him the Lord had said we were to go on
that train, and there must be a place somewhere
for us. He said he knew he had not a berth left.
I said we must have two upper berths, as we
did not have sufficient money for lower berths.
The $4 given by the little sister in Colorado
Springs as our train was leaving and the $3.00
we had was all we had for the berths. Just
then a man stepped up and said there were two
upper berths left, as some people had decided
not to go on that train. “Well,” said the agent,
“I guess they are for you, but you will have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hurry, as the train is ready to go.” Entering
the coach we found the two berths were together.
How the Lord does plan for His children, opening
doors which no man can shut. <b>Hallelujah!</b></p>

<p>As we neared the California border the strike
came on that paralyzed all street-car and train
service for ten days. Three times the men
were about to leave our train out on the desert.
But we prayed, and God took the train through
to Los Angeles. Other trains that started were
forsaken by the trainmen and hundreds of people
were left in the desert without food or water.
Relief was sent to them by auto trucks, and they
came through in that way. But God spoke to
us, and we obeyed, and went on the last train
that got through for over ten days.</p>

<p>How God does care for His own! We were
going out as missionaries and He wanted to
teach us lessons of faith. That is why He took
us along with just enough money for one trip at
a time. Many times we were without money or
had but little. Then, He would tell us not to
look at our little means, but to look to Him,
with Heaven’s great storehouse full for all who
would believe. “<b>The just shall live by faith.</b>”
The new creature in Christ Jesus becomes heir
to ALL His riches in glory. “<b>O the depth of
the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
of God! how unsearchable are His
judgments, and His ways past finding
out!</b>” Rom. 11:33.</p>

<p>We arrived in Los Angeles with seventy-five
cents. The taxi man asked $4 to take us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the camp-grounds, and no street cars were
running. We asked Father how we were to get
out there. It was too far to walk. I was
directed to a little lunch-counter across the
street, to ask the man about a machine standing
in front of his place. He told me he would
take us out there, as he was carrying passengers
since the strike was on. We asked him
the fare and he said, “Seventy-five cents.” We
laughed, for Father knew just how much we
had, and would not let him ask more.</p>

<p>We reached the camp-grounds about nine
o’clock. The Evangelist was preaching on faith,
and how we should trust God. She stretched
out her arm toward us and said, in a loud
voice, “<b>The just shall live by faith</b>.” This
was a familiar text to us, as it had been our
motto for some three months, or more, but it is
always new.</p>

<p>Brother Fisher came and said, “We have a
tent up and ready for you, but we have made no
arrangements for meals for you, as everybody
makes their own arrangements for those.” We
praised God for the tent and knew He would
take care of the rest, for He had sent us there,
so He would provide.</p>

<p>We were invited home with some friends that
night, but returned to the camp to stay the next
morning. Noon came. Everybody was going
out to the stand to get lunch. We had to pray.
So we went into our little tent, knelt down and
told our Heavenly Father about our needs. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
says He knows our needs before we ask Him,
but we receive by asking. It is so sweet to tell
Him about every little need. We had spoken
to no one else about them, as that would not be
faith. We went across the grounds to the big
tent. A sister came, put her arms around me,
and said, “Sister, are you a missionary?” I
told her we were just going out for the first
time. She said the Lord had laid it on her
heart to open a dining tent for the missionaries
on the camp-ground, and she wanted to invite
me and my little family to eat with them. I
need not say that dining tent was one of the
sweetest places I have ever seen. We would
gather there and sing and praise God and eat
the food He had provided. It was Heaven on
earth. I am sure dear Sister Craton and her
sister, who worked so faithfully, will receive
abundant reward when Jesus comes.</p>

<p>The meeting was wonderful. The Word was
preached under the mighty anointing every
afternoon and night. Hundreds were brought
in and baptized in the Holy Spirit, and many
were healed. One day they carried in a Jew.
He was an invalid, had been sick for many
years and did not believe the Bible or in God.
We gathered around him and prayed. A great
ball of fire came down through the tent, struck
that man on the head, knocked him out of his
chair and on to his feet, and almost knocked
down all who were praying with him. He was
healed and baptized in the Holy Spirit, and ran
over the grounds leaping and praising God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Many things God did there that strengthened
our faith and prepared us for the life of faith on
the mission field.</p>

<p>After the camp-meeting we rented a little
apartment where we might live and make ready
for our trip, for there was sewing to be done and
things to be made ready. We were expecting to
sail about the first of October. But one day,
as we were praying about when we should sail,
the Lord said, “You will sail about the first of
the year.” We thought that was a long time
off, and did not understand why we were to
wait so long. Going to the steamship office we
learned that the port of Corinto, where we were to
land, was under quarantine for yellow fever, and
had been for several months, but the ban would
be lifted about the first of the year, and it was.</p>

<p>They were precious months that followed.
Everything that we needed had to be prayed in—trunks,
suitcases, clothing, everything came
in answer to prayer.</p>

<p>While in San Francisco I was very busy in
meetings and had many letters to write. Sister
Kerr said, “Ask the Lord to give you a typewriter
to take with you.” “Oh,” I said, “I could
never have faith for a typewriter, as I could get
along without that, and need so many other
things.” While I was praying in my room the
Lord said to me, “You can have faith for a
typewriter. Ask for one, and you shall have it.”
I said, “Lord, I do not know how to use a typewriter.”
He told me that when I went back to
Los Angeles I could go to night school and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
learn to use a typewriter, and then He would
give me one. This I did, and soon learned how
to typewrite. Then I received a letter from a
brother enclosing a check for $50, saying it was
for a Corona typewriter to take to the mission
field. I had never seen the brother and do not
know how he knew of me, but God knows. I
almost ran to the Corona office to get my typewriter,
and with it I am writing this book.</p>

<p><b>“I love the Lord, because He hath heard
my voice and my supplications. Because
He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore
will I call upon Him as long as I live.”</b>—Psalm
116:1, 2.</p>

<p>While in Oakland dear sister Rawlins told me
the Lord had spoken to her to take her new Singer
sewing machine, go home with me to Los Angeles
and do up all my sewing. Here again was the
dear loving hand of my Heavenly Father. He
said He would give me mothers and brothers and
sisters. This dear sister was truly a mother to
me. She came with me, did up the sewing,
and, as we were packing ready to leave for the
mission field, and she to return to Oakland, she
gave me the machine to take with me. How
sweet that God has so many precious children
who are ready to lay down their lives for the
Gospel. We may not all be called to go, but
we all can do our part. God bless every one
who has given so freely and made it possible
for the missionaries to go. As I think of the
many things and the money that have been
given by the dear children of God, it makes me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fear I may not prove true and use it all to His
glory. But there is a cry in my soul that the
Lord will help me to be faithful, and render unto
the Lord for all His benefits unto me. Psalm
116:12.</p>

<p>Everything was provided for the trip. New
trunks were sent up to the house. Two nice
handbags were given. One woman gave my
daughter and me beautiful riding suits made
to order. A certain book I had long been wanting
to read, and had not been able to get, was
brought and laid on our table when I was out.
Many little tokens of love were brought by the
saints—nice useful things.</p>

<p>But there was one thing lacking, a most important
one. That was our fare. The Lord had
miraculously interfered and gotten us our passports,
and everything was packed and ready,
but no money for the fare, which was near
$700.00, including excess baggage. One morning,
while praying in my room, the Lord said,
“Go to the steamship office and make
your reservations.” “But, Lord, I haven’t
the money to pay down.” He said, “Get ready;
I will send the money.” By the time I was
dressed and ready, a friend entered the room and
gave me $15. Well, why hadn’t the Lord sent
all that was needed for the fare? Never mind;
He had another lesson of faith to teach us. I
went to the office and found out about the steamers.
One sailed January 12th. The Lord said
“Take that one.” Different faithful friend,
asked, “When does the steamer sail?” We told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
them. “And you haven’t your fare yet?” “No,
we haven’t the fare yet, but it is coming.” They
said they did not believe we were to sail so soon
or God would have sent the fare. But we knew
God had spoken and we believed.</p>

<p>One afternoon a woman came with a message
which she claimed was from God. Some of them
had been praying about our going, and had received
a message that we were not to go yet.
Instead we were to go to a certain place and
open a work. For that reason God had
not sent us our fare. I replied, “I can’t believe
that, for God has spoken to me many times, and
this message is the same that came through my
lips in San Francisco, when He told me that we
were to sail about the first of the year.” At
that time, as already related, we found the port
was under quarantine that would be lifted about
the first of the year. Later we found it had been
lifted, and the Lord had told us we were to sail
on the steamer that went on Jan. 12.</p>

<p>We kept in sweet communion with the Lord,
and every time these friends came with a message,
He whispered to us to be still and know He
was God; and we should see His salvation.
Time went by. Only a week more before sailing,
and we must have our ticket in three days in
order to have our baggage attended to, still
there was no money in sight. We kept praising
the Lord that He had spoken, and it would come
to pass. A dear saint, we thought much of,
came in. She asked if we had our fare. We
said we had not. She said, “Surely there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
something wrong. God does not want you to
go now.” But we quietly praised God. He
had spoken, and it was so. Like Paul, we
thanked God and took courage, when it
seemed that everything was against us on every
side, and the darkest hour was there. Then
came dear Brother Norris from San Bernardino,
California. He said the Lord had sent him to
pay our fares. So he went down and paid for
our tickets and excess baggage.</p>

<p>Why did we have this test? It was just one
more lesson for us to learn. We must come to
the place where we know the voice of the Lord
and there must be no mistake about it. He
wants us to know beyond the shadow of a doubt.
We are in dark days and there are many spirits
to deceive. We must know the voice of God,
and then, no matter how impossible it may
seem, follow His voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Many were the tests and trials we passed
through, but glorious was the victory He gave
in the end.</p>

<h2 id="BREAD_UPON_THE_WATERS">BREAD UPON THE WATERS<br />
<span class="smaller">From Los Angeles to Nicaragua, C. A.</span></h2>

<p>We sailed from Los Angeles, on the S. S.
Curacao, January 12th, 1920. After five days
we arrived at the port of Matzalan, Mexico.
The first sight of the city was the large cathedral
on the hill. Our boat came to anchor, and as
it was to stay a whole day, we took a launch and
went ashore.</p>

<p>The city was very beautiful, nestling in the
valley, surrounded by mountains and sea. The
beach was thronged with bathers. The streets
and courts were lined with tropical flowers,
palm and cocoanut trees. The sun was so warm
that we were soon persuaded to remove our
coats and sweaters, and we stepped into a hotel
court to rest.</p>

<p>We noticed one beggar after another coming
in and asking alms. Going out into the streets
again we noticed they seemed to be filled with
poor, ragged, barefoot people begging. On inquiry
we were told this was “Beggars’ Day,”
when the poor came out and received help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">S. S. Curacao on which we sailed to the Mission field</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>As we sat in the plaza and saw all the sin and
wickedness around us, we were reminded of
Paul’s experience at Athens. His spirit was
stirred when he saw the city wholly given to
idolatry, and found the altar with the inscription,
“To the unknown God.” Truly our spirits
were stirred when we saw the high spires on the
cathedral, and the altar within, and realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that God was not known to the people. The
many beggars were a striking picture of the
great need of the whole city. The beggars’
dirty rags told of their need of the robes of
righteousness. Their bare feet showed the need of
being shod with the preparation of the Gospel of
Peace, for truly they had no peace. Many of
them were blind, and surely they were blind to
the truth. Beggars would come and touch us,
and ask alms. Like Peter and John, silver and
gold we did not have, but we could tell them of
Jesus, and we did so. But they were so blind
and deaf they did not seem to know what we
were talking about.</p>

<p>We were taken by a gentleman in a carriage
to see the places of interest in the city, which
were many. Then we returned to the ship, but
found it would not be ready to sail for some time
yet. We seated ourselves on the deck and
watched the many boats and launches that
covered the waters. The wind was strong and
the waves ran high. We saw a small row-boat
with two men in it, rowing hard for the shore.
It made me think of the great mass of people
here who were being tossed by the waves of sin.</p>

<p class="center"><b>“Captain, Lower the Gang-Plank
for I am Coming.”</b></p>

<p>Then the Spirit gave me a picture of the sinner
as the small boat tossed to and fro by the
high waves of sin. The large steamer, with all
her passengers, very peaceful, and with no toiling
to keep afloat, represented the children of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
God with all His cargo of love and grace in their
souls. They did not have to work to keep
saved, but He saved them and they were at
home on the waters of His love. I seemed to
hear the Lord say that as the waters of this
mighty ocean could come in on that little boat,
and sink it beneath its waves, never again to be
found, even so His great love for the sinner could
come in on his frail bark of sin, swallow it up,
and sink it in the sea of forgetfulness, never
again to be found.</p>

<p>Darkness began to settle over the waters.
The whistle had blown, the gang plank been
pulled in, and the vessel was slowly moving away.
Suddenly we heard a cry coming over the waves,
<b>“Captain, lower the gang plank, for I am
coming.”</b> In the dim evening light we could
see a man standing in the launch that was coming
as fast as it could. Again the cry came,
<b>“Captain, lower the gang plank, for I am
coming.”</b> It was our freight clerk, who had
been ashore, drinking and indulging in sin, until
he had almost missed his opportunity to get on
board. But at the captain’s command they
lowered the gang plank, the clerk jumped on it
and came on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus5">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">On Board Ship</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>To me this taught a lesson. The big ship
Salvation has pulled into the harbor of the
needy, the needy one comes in his little row-boat
of trouble and cries for help, and the gang
plank, the Gospel of love, is let down to him, and
he jumps on and is saved. So, as we go among
these needy people, in their little old row-boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
toiling on the angry waters of sin, we hope to
see the dear old Gospel ship of Zion pull into
many a harbor, and lower the gang plank of
love and mercy, and see people jumping on and
coming aboard for the glory-land. For truly,
Jesus is coming soon, and what we do we must
do quickly, ere they perish.</p>

<p>At another port we had to wait a day for the
unloading of cargo. Many natives came to the
ship to sell birds and different things, and we had
a wonderful opportunity to give out the Word of
God to them. How eager they were to hear of
the love of God to save them. One old man
came up out of his little boat and said. “Are
there many people in your country who know
about this great God, and how He sent His Son
to die for us?” We told him there were many
who knew about it. Then he said, “Why don’t
they come and tell us about it and help us to
find Him.” We were speechless, for we knew
there were few who would leave all to tell them
of Jesus and His power to save.</p>

<p class="center"><b>“I’ll Be Waiting for You When Your
Ship Returns.”</b></p>

<p>Several little boys came on board from the
many boats and lighters, and played with Carl.
He brought out his little train, that ran on a
track. They had never seen anything like that
before, so they spent the day with him. We gave
each one tracts and a Testament to carry home.
How their little dark faces did shine with delight
when we told them of the love of Jesus for every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
one of them, and how God had sent us to tell
the people to get ready, for He was soon coming
back to earth. One little fellow was very much
interested, asking many questions about the
Bible and the tracts we had given him.</p>

<p>Just then the bell rang, and orders were given
for every visitor to get off, for the ship was ready
to go. As this dear little fellow took Carl’s hand
and shook it he said, <b>“I will be waiting for
you when you come back. I will wait every
day till I see this ship return, and then you
can tell me more about Jesus and how to
find this peace you have.”</b></p>

<p>He rowed away in a small boat, and, as far as
we could see, we saw his little hand waving, and
heard him saying, <b>“I will be waiting for you
when you come back.”</b></p>

<p>How we wept, for we knew we would not come
that way again, and realized that the little
fellow might never again hear the Gospel. Shall
we fail to go to them with the bread of life?</p>

<h2 id="THE_STARS_AND_STRIPES_AND">THE STARS AND STRIPES AND
BEAUTIFUL MANZANILLA</h2>

<p>We reached Manzanilla on January 19th.
Pulling ourselves up on the dock out of the little
boat that brought us ashore, and walking a
short distance, we came to the street on the
water front. It was filled with people
who had gathered to see the ship come in. With
eager faces they watched the unloading of the
cargo. We thought if only the many launches and
boats that had gone to the ship for passengers
and cargo could bring messengers and messages
to this hungry people’s souls, what a blessed
thing it would be!</p>

<p>We walked through the little city. The streets
were filled with barefoot men, women, and
children, many of whose clothes were ragged and
dirty. Many pigs and sick dogs were roaming
about eagerly hunting food, which appeared to
be scarce. Our hearts were touched. As we
looked up to Heaven there came a cry from my
soul for the deliverance of these people.</p>

<p>Our attention was attracted by the ringing of
a bell away up the mountain side. There we
saw a small white Temple. The people began
to swarm up there, answering the call of the bell.
We went up with them. As we stepped inside
the great iron gate that is kept closed at all
other times, but was now opened for the people
to enter, we saw the poor barefoot, ragged
creatures enter, and kneeling down, make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
sign of the cross and worship the tall image
before them, then rise to their feet and pass
out.</p>

<p>The floor of the temple was dirty, and the
seats covered with dust. We were made to
think of the Scripture in Isaiah 1:6:</p>

<p><b>“From the sole of the foot even unto
the head there is no soundness in it; but
wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores;
they have not been closed, neither bound
up, neither mollified with ointment. Your
country is desolate.”</b></p>

<p>Surely the whole country is devoid of the
power and glory of the God who made them
in His own image.</p>

<p>As we stood there in the gate of the temple,
we saw, high up on the mountain, the American
flag waving in the ocean breezes. The flag was
on the home of the American consul. It seemed
to speak of freedom for that poor suffering
people.</p>

<p>Oh that God’s children, who have been
touched by Divine power and filled with God’s
love, would go in upon the wings of faith and
prayer, lift the blood-stained banner of Jesus,
and wave it o’er this desolate land till it resounds
with the falling of the Latter Rain, which
is able to make it bud and bloom and bring
forth fruit unto eternal life!</p>

<p>Upon returning to our ship the burden was
so heavy on me that I fell on my knees and cried
to God to save these people. Then the Lord said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p><b>“What thou seest, write in a book, and
send it unto the churches.”—Rev. 1:11, 19.</b></p>

<p>We saw men with bands around their heads
holding great packs on their necks. They were
carrying loads from the boats which were bringing
the ship’s cargo to shore. Truly they were
pictures of the spiritual bondage of the people
staggering under their burdens of sin, and with
the yoke of the devil on their necks.</p>

<h2 id="SALINA_CRUZ_MEXICO">SALINA CRUZ, MEXICO.<br />
<span class="smaller">My Vision Interpreted</span></h2>

<p>Here God gave me the interpretation of the
vision which I had when I was saved, fifteen
years before. From under the altar where I
was kneeling I saw a great white cloud boiling
out, full of upstretched black hands.</p>

<p>We were in Mexican waters and there was
some trouble at this port. We expected to stay
there about two days. Everyone was cautioned
to be careful not to do or say anything that
would stir up trouble. As we had been giving
out tracts and Bibles at every port as we came
down, we thought to do the same here, but we
were told it would be dangerous to do so for it
might cause a disturbance.</p>

<p>As we sat there and saw the dear people come
down to the boat to sell things, our hearts were
stirred, for we saw them as sheep having no
shepherd. A group of fruit peddlers was sitting
near. Taking some Spanish tracts and Testaments,
I went over and talked to them as much
as I could with my limited knowledge of the
language, and gave them Gospel literature. A
crowd gathered around, each holding out a hand
for tracts. Even the custom house officers
dressed in white, as is customary in the tropics,
came over. The people came running from all
sides, till soon I was pressed upon by them.
Some flat cars were standing near. I climbed
upon one of these to get out of the press, but
the people climbed up, too, holding out their
black hands for the little messengers. There
must have been two or three hundred crowding
around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a><br /><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>As I was up there on that flat car looking down
upon the poor hungry souls, holding out their
black hands for the Bread of Life, I began to
weep, and to speak in tongues. God spoke
through me in Spanish to these dear hearts,
telling them the story of the cross, and how and
why Jesus died for us. It must have been an
hour that I stood there in the hot sun, talking
to them. They wept and begged for more
tracts to carry home to their loved ones. One
man, who could speak English, said to me, “We
did not think you could speak our language so
well,” then he told me what I had said.</p>

<p>And there my vision of the white cloud full of
black hands was interpreted. Dressed in white,
they were reaching out black hands for the
gospel. Shall they call in vain? Oh, no! We
will carry to them the gospel, the blessed story
of Jesus and His wonderful love. They, too,
shall be saved and ready when He comes.</p>

<p>In many places in Mexico the power of God
is falling. In one place a Mexican heard the
gospel and was saved. He began preaching to
the people. The Holy Spirit fell, and about a
hundred received the Baptism. They were calling
for a missionary to come to them. Shall
we linger? Shall we not answer these calls?</p>

<h2 id="THE_VIRGIN_OF_THE_ANGELS">THE VIRGIN OF THE ANGELS</h2>

<p>The people worship many different kinds of
idols. Sometimes they walk hundreds of miles
to do penance to some stick of wood or piece of
stone which has been set up by the priests.</p>

<p>We met one young man who told us he had
crawled three hundred miles, carrying a golden
dish, valued at ten thousand dollars. This idol
to which he crawled is in Costa Rica, and is
called “<b>The Virgin of the Angels</b>.” The
people have been made to believe that this little
image of black stone, three and a half inches
high, can perform all sorts of miracles such as
opening blind eyes, healing the deaf, and driving
away evil spirits. The temple in which this idol
is kept was built at a cost of one million dollars.
Once a year this “Virgin of the Angels” is carried
to visit all the other santos (saints-idols) that
she may bless them, and give them more power
for the ensuing year. This immense temple is
literally lined with gold and silver dishes and
cooking utensils brought there by the rich inhabitants
of the country, with the hope that the
image would bless and heal them. Just outside
the temple are stacks of corn, bananas, coffee,
sticks and stones, which the poor people have
brought that they, too, might have their sins
taken away and their diseases healed.</p>

<p>They are begging for the Gospel. Their call
comes to you and me,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><b>“Come over and help us!”</b></p>

<p class="noindent">and God asks, “<b>Who will go for us?</b>”
Isaiah 6:8. Who will leave home, friends,
and loved ones, and go out, not knowing whither
they go? They will have to eat native foods
that are unclean and unwholesome, and which
may cause fevers and various sicknesses. They
may have to sleep in old dirty native huts,
where mosquitos, scorpions, bats, and vermin
will attack them. Nevertheless God is calling
now, as He called in Isaiah’s day, “WHO WILL
GO FOR US?” Jesus is Coming Soon! The
message must go forth regardless of the cost.</p>

<p>As we went aboard the ship, the Lord said to
me,</p>

<p class="center"><b>“Cast thy bread upon the waters.”</b></p>

<p>Many dear souls were reached by the tracts on
the different vessels upon which we traveled. To
God be all the glory! Eternity alone will reveal
the number who received the Gospel in this way.
Passengers and crews alike read the tracts, and
called for more. People from all parts of the
world have taken the little messengers with
them and as they have grasped our hands with
a hearty “Good-bye, and God bless you in your
work,” our own souls have been blessed and
refreshed, for we have seen the Word of God, that
liveth and abideth forever, finding its way into
the hearts of men and women.</p>

<p>People who were sick and afflicted, traveling
in search of health, have heard the message of
healing through Jesus Christ, and have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
healed, as we told them of the body of Christ
that was broken for us, and that by His
stripes we were healed. Souls who had sought
comfort and rest in various religions, hearing
the story of the cross, and of how Jesus died
that we might live, have accepted Him, and
gone on their way rejoicing.</p>

<p><b>“Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou
shalt find it after many days.”</b> Eccles. 11:1.
We know that when we reach the pearly gates
of Heaven we shall see many who have been redeemed
from sin, because they read and heard
the Bread of the Word, which we cast upon the
waters.</p>

<p>While we were giving out tracts and Testaments
to the people who came to sell fruit and
birds in one port in Mexico, we met a Mexican
who had never heard the Gospel, or seen a Bible
or a missionary before. I gave him a tract, in
his own language, on the second coming of the
Lord. He looked at the tract, then at me, and
then said, “What is this for?” I told him it was
a tract telling of the soon coming of Jesus back
to this earth again. I could not speak or understand
much Spanish. He said, “I will read it,
then bring someone to interpret for me, for I
want to know more about this.” He went away,
and in a few minutes came back with a young
man who could speak English, for his interpreter.</p>

<p>He asked me where I heard the Lord was
soon coming back again. I said I had read it
in the Bible, and that God was pouring out the
Holy Spirit upon the earth in these last days;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
that thousands were receiving the Spirit, and that
the Holy Spirit is revealing to the people that
Jesus is coming soon.</p>

<p>He then told us he had been going all over
Mexico, Central and South America, visiting
idols and saints, walking several thousands of
miles, carrying heavy loads of gifts to these
idols in the attempt to get peace of soul,
but had not found it. At last, sick and weary,
and in despair, he gave up.</p>

<p>He was wondering if there were a God and had
asked that if there were He should make Himself
known to him in some way. Then he said he saw
a great, strong man coming up out of the sea, so
powerful that he could make every nation of the
world bow to him. This man destroyed the
Pope of Rome and the Catholic Church, built a
great church for himself, and sought to compel
all the world to worship him, but there were
many who would not do this, so he made war
against them, killing them all, and the earth was
covered with blood. The people called on God to
stop the terrible war and take away this man
from the earth. Then Jesus came on a great
white horse with many angels following him,
destroyed the wicked man, and set up a beautiful
kingdom of peace, in which everyone was so
happy, and the whole earth became a great
beautiful garden.</p>

<p class="caption">A Native Village</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Then this Mexican said, “I felt very happy in
my heart, and had such great peace of mind.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
He had prayed God to send someone to tell
him more of this way. He said he was very
astonished to find someone giving out tracts on
the ship. Always before when he made his
trips he saw only gambling and dancing, but
this time he found people preaching the Gospel.</p>

<p>He went away happy, to tell his people he had
found the Bible and the Way of Life. He talked
to all the Mexicans on board, telling them
how God had answered his prayer.</p>

<p>One man, who owned a gold mine in Mexico,
and had been in the United States and was returning,
told us, as we were giving out literature
to the people, that we were the first missionaries
he ever met coming that way. He said he
had been in Mexico forty years, had made many
trips back and forth, but had met no Christians
in those parts before. He himself knew something
of the Gospel, and was glad to have the
papers, and told us of the great need among
the people there.</p>

<p>Oh! shall not we who have received this great
outpouring of the Spirit, cry, as did the holy ones
in Isaiah, “<i>Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts!</i>”
till the whole earth be filled with His glory? As
I write in the hot state-room of the ship, my
soul is full of glory, and my hands are
being moved over the typewriter by the power
of the Spirit, while He tells me that Jesus is
coming soon, that we must work fast, and open
our souls to Himself until we are filled with His
power and glory, so that the people with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
we come in contact will know we have been
with Him, and learned of Him.</p>

<p>A young man came to me and said, “I heard
you praying in your state-room this morning.
May I come in next time when you have prayer?
I want to know about the Gospel.” We had given
him a Testament. The next morning he came
and knelt with us and prayed to the Lord to save
him. He arose, with his face shining with the
glory of God, saying, “Won’t you come to my
country and tell my people about Jesus? My
mother has been making long trips to worship
‘The Black Christ’ in the great temple on the
Honduras border, but she hasn’t found peace.
Won’t you come and tell her of this wonderful
salvation?” We corresponded with him later,
sending him tracts and papers, and he is going
on with the Lord. Won’t you pray that God
will raise up someone who will go to them with
the Gospel before it is too late?</p>

<p>As I have already said, Central and South
America are opening their eyes, and fast turning
from Romanism. They are accepting Spiritualism,
New Thought, Christian Science, and
all kinds of false religions, because the true Gospel
is not being preached to them. Shall we
not awake, rise up, go forth with the message of
the cross, and reach these people before they are
destroyed with these awful things?</p>

<p>A man from Honduras, who had been in the
States studying New Thought, was returning
with several boxes of books to sell to the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
This dear young man had never heard the Gospel.
He said he found that Rome was keeping
the people in ignorance. Having met some New
Thought teachers in his country, he had been to
the States and studied New Thought for a year,
and was now returning to teach it to his people,
who, he said, were anxious to have him do so.</p>

<p>We gave him a Bible, the first he had ever
seen, and he read it every day. We talked and
prayed with him until he was saved, for the dear
old Word of God always wins its way into the
hearts of men. He threw the New Thought
books overboard and went on his way with
tracts, Testaments and Bibles for his people,
rejoicing that he had found the true God. Let
us pray for this precious soul, that God will
greatly use him. He is a finely educated young
man, whose influence will tell on his countrymen.</p>

<p>Oh! how glad we were we had been led to take
that boat, and had had the opportunity to give
the Bread of Life to that hungry man! God had
led us on that very ship, and certainly we were
blessed as we cast the Word of God forth and
saw many people running after it. There is a
great ministry on the ships, not only to passengers,
but also to the officers and crews. They
spend all their time on the water, and do not
have any opportunity to hear the Gospel, only
as it is taken to them.</p>

<p>Another man, a Jew, was very sick, had been
for a long time. He was traveling for his
health. As my husband spoke to him about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the Lord and told him God could heal him, he
said, “Well, I will come right into your room now
and have you pray for me. I am suffering so,
I can’t live until I reach my destination if I do
not get relief.” He came in and we prayed for
him, and anointed him with oil in the name of
the Lord, asking God to touch his body. Instantly
he threw up his hands and began to say,
“Glory! Glory! Glory!” The power fell on him,
and he was saved and healed. As he left the
boat he took with him some tracts and a Testament,
and, best of all, the glory of God in his
soul.</p>

<p>He declared he was going to preach the Gospel,
and he began right on the ship. He was so filled
with the power and glory of God he could not
keep from telling it. Here was one more poor
suffering soul who received the Bread of Life that
was cast upon the waters, and who went on his
way rejoicing, to tell the glad news to other suffering
ones.</p>

<p>Let us not be weary in well doing, but rise
up in faith and go forth in Jesus’ Name, casting
our bread upon the waters, for we shall find it
bringing forth life.</p>

<p>A woman that I spoke to became so interested
that she came every day for tracts and papers to
read. I also gave her some good books on the
second coming of the Lord, and on salvation.
She, too, was saved, and went away with her
suitcase full of the Word of God to give to her
people.</p>

<h2 id="ARRIVING_IN_OUR_PORT_AT">ARRIVING IN OUR PORT AT
NICARAGUA</h2>

<p>Nearing Nicaragua, in the distance we saw
three mountain peaks, and were told that was
the Port of Corinto, where we were to land. As
the ship moved on, we could see the light-house,
its white head towering high in the air pointing
out the way we were to go.</p>

<p>The scenery was beautiful. Cocoanut and
palm trees lined the beach. The sea was calm
and we slowly moved into the harbor,
getting a good view of the little city spread out
before us. Great peace settled down over our
souls, and the Holy Spirit whispered to us
that we were in His will. I stepped into my
stateroom and opened my Bible, and this passage
came to my sight:</p>

<p><b>“The Lord shall guide thee continually,
and satisfy thy soul in drouth, and make
fat thy bones; and thou shalt be like a
watered garden and like a spring of water
whose waters fail not.”</b>—Isa. 58:11.</p>

<p>We had cabled Brother Schoenich to meet us,
but our boat arrived two days earlier than
scheduled, and on going ashore, we found he
was not there. We went to work, speaking
some English and a little Spanish, and making
many signs and gestures. The next morning
Brother Schoenich arrived, and worked faithfully,
helping to get our things through the customs
house. After seeing that everything was
ready for the coretta (oxcart) ride to Matagalpa,
we took train for Leon.</p>

<p>Arriving at Leon we went to the home of one
of the native Christians. The food was strange and
new to us, but it came from a heart of love. The
next day was Sunday, and a company of dear
ones, who had been baptized in the Holy Spirit,
met for worship. Brother Schoenich preached
to them, admonishing them to stand true. They
had no pastor, but were going on with the Lord.</p>

<p>Next morning we went to the market to buy
food for our three days’ trip on mule back. We
found some of the saints there. They were
reading their Bibles, and witnessing for Jesus in
the midst of the priests and thousands of Catholics.
They had their walls covered with scripture
mottoes. When saved, these people make
good soldiers for Jesus, enduring hardness joyfully.
They remember the pit from whence
they were digged.</p>

<p>Bidding them good-bye, we prepared our
lunch, mounted our mules, and rode until about
ten o’clock that night. Stopping at a camp
ground for coretta travelers, we lit our candles,
ate our meal, strung up our hammocks, and lay
down to rest amid the lowing of the many oxen.
All coffee and freight is moved to and from the
interior on oxcarts (corettas in Spanish).</p>

<p>The next morning we made our toilet in and
by the large trough where the mules and oxen
were watered. After eating breakfast under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the shed of the native hut, we were off for our
day’s travel.</p>

<p>At noon we stopped again at a little house on the
hillside for food and water. While waiting for
the meal to be prepared we strung up our hammocks
for a rest. Our bodies were very tired,
as we had never ridden horseback before. By
this time we felt better down than up. Brother
Schoenich, being accustomed to these trips, did
not tire so easily, so he gathered the family
together and preached to them. It was the
first time they had heard the Gospel.</p>

<p>About five o’clock we again mounted our beasts,
and traveled until midnight. We passed over
some rough country, the many wild parrots and
birds seemed to be screeching and singing to
the dusty, wayworn travelers. Once in a while
we got a hot breath from the great volcano in
the distance whose smoke we could see billowing
up towards the clouds.</p>

<p>Again we had supper by candle-light, then
hung up our swinging beds in the corridor of an
adobe house, and rested till the dawn, when we
heard the now familiar alarm, the braying of
our faithful mules, who seemed to want to be
traveling. We arose, dressed, and soon were off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>At noon we stopped again for rest and for food.
The food they offered was so seasoned with flies
and worms that we decided to buy a chicken and
cook it ourselves. We bought a “fryer” but it
proved to be an old hen of many years. We
were invited by our hostess to come into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
kitchen to fry our fowl. As we were trying to
get the earthen pot fixed on the fire, which was
made in a sort of furnace in the corner, the
smoke poured out into the room.</p>

<p>We noticed some strange sights in that kitchen.
In one corner a nice fat pig was having his noon-day
swim in a trough of slop that had been arranged
for his benefit. Meanwhile a large red
rooster lifted up his merry “cock-a-doodle-doo”
above the noise of all the rest of the fowls and
animals that filled the place.</p>

<p>We managed to get the old hen smoked as well
as fried, and as we went out to place it on the
small table which had been fixed for us, we discovered
Brother Schoenich had gathered a company
together and in his enthusiastic way was
preaching to them, showing them that worshiping
the Virgin Mary and the santos, (saints),
and learning catechisms, etc., was not the true
religion of the Bible. They listened with great
interest, asking many questions about the Bible.</p>

<p>After our meal we lay down on some boards
to rest, and fell asleep, only to be awakened by
the chattering of many little voices. On investigating
we found the children were having school
in one room, all reading at the same time, taking
turns at the door with a stick to keep the pigs
and chickens out. We left there and traveled until
dark, then stopped for the night. Rising early
the next morning we traveled several leagues,
and then came in sight of the lovely little city of
Matagalpa, nestling at the foot of the mountains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
The only evil and unlovely thing, there, was man,
who has sinned and gone far away from God.</p>

<p>Dear Sister Schoenich and some of the native
Christians came out to meet us, as Isaac came out
to meet Rebekah. We alighted, had a drink of
water, and rested a little before going into town.
We certainly were glad to see the entrance-gate
to our new home, which was, I think, the largest
gate I had ever seen. We thought of our entrance
through the gate of Heaven, after our
long, weary journey through this world of sin
and sorrow.</p>

<p>On dismounting, we were met by some more
of our dear brown-faced friends who had gathered
to greet the new missionaries. When we saw
their faces shining with the glory of God, and
heard them sing the praises of Jesus we were
refreshed in soul and body. After a few hours
of rest we were able to go into the meeting and
help push the battle for our King.</p>

<p>We will work here with Brother and Sister
Schoenich for a while, for they have a large
work, and need help. They are much worn in
body after almost eight years on the field, and
need a furlough. Pray for us. The fields are
white unto harvest, and the laborers are few. We
want to bring some glad trophies home to God.</p>

<h2 id="OUR_STAY_IN_MATAGALPA">OUR STAY IN MATAGALPA</h2>

<p>Our stay in Matagalpa was a very pleasant
and profitable one in many ways. It was a great
pleasure to see the way God worked among the
dear natives. They were delighted to come and
worship the Lord, and anxious to see others of
their people brought into the fold. The awful
sins and idolatry of these people are beyond our
power to describe.</p>

<p>We had been there about four days when
Brother and Sister Schoenich were called to one
of their other stations over in the mountains.
Perhaps you can imagine us poor little folks
there without the language, taking care of the
station and carrying on the meetings while they
were away. Rising very early to help them off
before the sun was hot, we bade them good-bye,
then turned our faces toward Heaven and asked
God to help us, for we were there, and must be
brave soldiers, not get frightened and run away
from the battle. The Holy Spirit fell upon us,
and the Lord spoke to us saying He would be
mouth and wisdom unto us.</p>

<p>As we stepped into the corridor leading from
the yard, we met our first problem, which was
to speak to one who knew only the Spanish
language, with no one to interpret for us. The
man from the finca (little farm) had come in to
ask for the hammer. He talked and laughed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and we all talked and laughed, and tried to see
whether we could get what he wanted. We
brought him the horses, the harness, and almost
everything in the kitchen. At last we took him
into the tool room to let him see if what he
wanted was there, and he picked up the hammer.
Ever after that we remembered the Spanish
word for hammer. But, oh my! there was a
pile of things lying all over the corridor to be
picked up and put in their places. However,
it was a very effectual way to get the language.</p>

<p>Next the girl in the kitchen must be told what
to cook for dinner. Into the kitchen I went,
knowing the mountain was before me, and must
be surmounted, and I meant, by the help of the
Lord, to go over the top. Putting out the
things for her to cook, I showed her by signs,
as much as possible, how they were to be fixed.
She did pretty well and the meals were good.</p>

<p>But the worst was to come. The next morning
was Sunday, and there were the dear natives
gathering into the chapel. What were we
to do? Oh, we felt so helpless! Down on our
faces we went to ask God to come upon us that
day, and fill us with his power and pour out the
Spirit on all the dear people. We took our
Spanish song books, and went in, and played and
sang the hymns the best we could. We had
learned to say, “<b>Let us pray</b>,” so we knelt down
and, we in English, and they in Spanish, poured
out our supplications before the Lord, and the
power fell. We were there over two hours, just
worshiping the Lord, and the language was well
understood by all, for the Holy Spirit did the
speaking and worshiping, and we did not make
an effort to do anything. Oh, how we did feel
the mighty presence of the Holy One that day!</p>

<p>The next day many new things came up.
First there was the laundry to send out, then
the marketing to be done. We all rose early,
got our Spanish grammars, and, by the time the
woman came for the washing, we were ready to
speak a few words to her about it. Then we
studied what to say at the market, and my husband
came home with some of the things we
wanted, and some things we didn’t want, but we
were learning the language right along.</p>

<p>I wanted to season something with butter, so
called to the cook to hurry and bring it to me.
I thought she was awfully slow. Hearing a
great noise behind me, I turned and saw her
leading the horse into the kitchen. I had
asked for the horse, instead of the butter, to put
into the cooking. After a hearty laugh from all
of us, I went into my room for my Spanish
grammar and looked up the word for butter, to
be sure I should not make that mistake again.</p>

<p>Things were going pretty well by this time,
except for the few mistakes we made occasionally.</p>

<p>The next thing I called for was a spoon,
with which to eat my soup. They brought the
broom in, and laid it on the table. I couldn’t
very well eat soup with the broom, so sent it
back and kept asking for a spoon, until either I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
had the word right, or they guessed what I
wanted, I don’t know which.</p>

<p>We employed a teacher and every morning
for a couple of hours we studied the language.
This was a great help. We soon were able to
ask for butter or spoons with no such mistakes,
and before long we could sing and read our
Bibles quite well, also give our testimonies in
Spanish. From day to day we could note the
progress we made in learning the language.</p>

<p>Then came the day when Brother and Sister
Schoenich returned home. They were tired and
worn, for they had been working very hard in
the meetings while away, and we wished we
could take all the burdens from them, and let
them rest. But there were many things to attend
to. They went right to printing the paper,
toiling almost day and night, not sparing themselves
one moment. These dear souls have
come into this dark land of sin and idolatry and
laid down their lives for the Gospel. Let us
hold them up in prayer and by our means. Let
every reader of this book breathe a prayer to
God for these dear workers. Their bodies are
tired and worn and they need a rest very badly.
May the Lord of the harvest send forth laborers
to this dark land to take their place long enough
for them to have a furlough. Many were the
precious lessons of faith and love we learned
from them for which we praise God.</p>

<p>The days went by. Three months passed.
We had no thought of leaving, until one day
while we were out giving tracts to the Indians
as they passed by, God spoke to me and said,
“Go to Leon.” We didn’t see how we could
possibly do that, for we had so little of the language,
and no money to go with, and it would
take at least seventy-five dollars. But as we
waited before the Lord, we were sure it was His
dear will. Then we asked for the means to be
sent for the oxcart to carry our baggage over
the mountains. The next mail brought a draft
for just the amount needed. Brother and Sister
Schoenich told us that before Sister Yeagges’
death she had said the Lord showed her we were
the missionaries for Leon. At that time we
had never met any of the workers, but had been
merely corresponding with them.</p>

<p>Then there was the packing of our things in
preparation for the trip, which was a long tiresome
one over the mountains and plains under
the tropical sun. We worked hard, and in one
week were off. Brother Schoenich took us down
on his mules, which was very kind of him. His
heart is in the work in this country, and he has
been willing to make every sacrifice to get the
Gospel to these people.</p>

<h2 id="LEAVING_MATAGALPA_FOR_LEON">LEAVING MATAGALPA FOR LEON</h2>

<p>After seeing our trunks and baggage loaded
on the oxcart, and started on the way, we set
about to prepare a lunch for the trip, as the only
food available while traveling through the country
is tortillas, (corn cakes), and frijoles, (beans),
and many times one cannot even get these, for
the people are very poor, many of them living
on roots and leaves from certain trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>After saying good-bye to Sister Schoenich,
and to the native Christians who had gathered
to see us off, we mounted our beasts and were
soon on our way through the little village, waving
good-bye to the many friends we had met
while there. The road being very good for
some distance we had several races, and we remarked
how clean we then were, but how different
we would look on reaching our destination.
The sun was just sinking behind the
western hills and we could see the natives driving
in the animals for the night. As we rode on
we saw the hills were all on fire, for the custom
there is to burn all the shrubbery before
planting crops. As we saw the great flames
winding their way up the tall trees, and flashing
into the air, burning up the thorns and briers,
and leaving the ground clean so the seed which
was to be planted might grow, there came to
my mind the thought that even so, the power
and fire of God could fall on that country and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
burn up all the awful sin and idolatry which
was binding those people, so that the Word of
God could be sowed and bring forth fruit in
their lives. And there arose from our hearts, a
cry to our Heavenly Father to send out His
messengers into that needy land to light the
fires of the Holy Spirit, till sin should be burned,
and the people be freed.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Riding until about 10 o’clock, passing over some
very rough road, we reached a little village.
Being very tired and hungry, we decided to
stop here for the night. We hung our swinging
beds up in the shed of the native hut, which was
used for a saloon, and after eating our scanty
meal by candle-light, we committed ourselves
to the keeping of the One who never slumbers
nor sleeps, then lay down to rest amid the talking
of many other travelers, who were stopping
there for the night. Each one carried in his
belt a big revolver, and a machette (a large
knife), which all the people, even the children,
carry, and with which they kill one another,
when they become angry. Nevertheless we were
conscious of the angels camping around us, and
there was no fear in our hearts.</p>

<p>Awakening next morning very early, we
arose and brushed off the dust which covered
us from the constant traveling on the road, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
which we had been sleeping, for the people
travel all through the night, as in the day the
sun is very hot. We ate our breakfast again
by candle-light, and after our morning prayer, we
mounted and were off for a day’s trip. Though
our bodies were very tired we went on singing
and praising God for the glorious privilege of
carrying the Gospel message to that dark land.</p>

<p>We rode until about noon, when we came to a
stream of water which looked very refreshing to
us. The poor animals were so glad to see that
water that when they got in it they drank, and
drank, and drank. We spread our lunch on the
sand, and washed ourselves and drank heartily,
for that was the first water we had seen for two
days except the little the natives had given us
to drink. Then came one who told us that just
upstream all the dead animals of the neighborhood
were thrown in. But we claimed the
promise, that “<b>If ye drink any deadly thing
it shall not hurt you</b>.”—Mark 16:18.</p>

<p>After a rest for ourselves and beasts, we were
again on our way. The sun being very hot by
this time we prayed that the Lord would send
a cloud over it, which He did. Praise His Holy
Name! “The sun shall not smite you by day.”
We went on, passing over great rocks and
boulders. The mules had to climb up and over
them until at times it was impossible for
new and inexperienced riders as we were, to
stay in the saddles. However, some of us missed
our saddles only a few times and took a tumble.</p>

<p>Sister Finney, putting her confidence in a
broken part on the back of her saddle, fell off
as she was going up a steep place, and after
standing on her head for an instant, rolled
down the bank, the mule stepping on her chest.
Rising, she praised the Lord that He had sent
His angel and delivered her. She mounted,
and we were off again, after finding she was not
hurt. Evidently I did not have so much faith
in the matter of falling off mules, and rolling
round amid the rocks, for while passing through
a very deep cut, with high banks on either
side, the mule which I was riding pushed
against the bank, and having a bad saddle, I
lost my hold and fell under the animal’s feet.
She was kind enough not to step on the poor
missionary who was such an inexperienced rider,
but who had been called to learn, and she very
carefully stepped over me. I was picked up,
and, after a little prayer-meeting there in the
dust, I was able to remount and ride on to our
destination, thirty-five miles away. God wonderfully
blessed me and the Holy Spirit came
upon me, and I sang and praised the Lord in
tongues—with interpretation. All the way I
felt the strong arm of Jesus upholding me. On
arriving my foot was found to be badly broken
and crushed, and so swollen that I could hardly
remove my shoe.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord! He came down and blessed
my soul, and touched my body! How His love
did burn in my heart! As the devil seemed
to be angry I felt that I was surely called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
preach the Gospel in that place. The power went
through my poor, crushed and swollen foot until
it was entirely straightened, for it had been so
twisted that my toes were behind, and my heel
was in front. I could feel the bones set and
straightened as the mighty power surged through
like bolts of electricity. I did not stop preaching
although for a time I was unable to put my foot
to the floor, but the people came to me, sitting
there in the house, to ask about the Gospel.</p>

<p>One night I felt the healing touch so strong
that I knew I could walk, so, arising next morning,
I attempted to put on my shoe, but it
would not even go over my toes. Nevertheless,
I praised God, laced the shoe on the other foot,
ready to walk, and then kept pulling at the other
shoe until it went on. Soon it was laced up and
I was ready to walk. I went into the meetings,
and have been going ever since, and that foot
is as good as it ever was. How we do praise
Jesus that we can suffer for His name’s sake. No
warrior returns from battle without wounds, or
marks of hardships endured, and one national
hero declared he was sorry that he had but one
life to give for his country. Much more should
we endure and give, who are fighting for our
Heavenly country under the leadership of our
great Captain, King Jesus.</p>

<p>We have heard the Macedonian call, “<b>Come
Over and Help Us</b>,” and the love of God constrains
us, so “onward we must go, regardless of
the foe.” Truly these dear people are calling for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
us to come and give them the Gospel. Shall we
fail and allow them to perish without the knowledge
of the love of Him, who so freely died to
save them?</p>

<p>Late one afternoon we arrived at a small village,
and being tired from the hard day’s travel
we decided to stay for the night, but when we
stopped, ready to dismount, we were told that</p>

<p class="center"><b>Robbers</b></p>

<p class="noindent">had swept down from the mountains on the
towns and villages of that district, had robbed
the people, and driven off their stock. The
soldiers had been sent out, and already one
battle had been fought, and more trouble was
brewing, so it was very dangerous for us to be
traveling. We looked to the Lord for guidance,
and felt that we must lose no time, but taking
the Blood for our protection, should move on.
Arising at two o’clock the next morning we went
over the road on which the robbers were supposed
to be, through a dense forest, but saw
nor heard nothing except the many parrots and
birds, screeching and singing.</p>

<p>We made seventeen leagues that day, crossing
mountains and plains, stopping at noon at a
little hut by the roadside for food for the beasts
and rest for ourselves. We were received with
much hospitality by these people, with their
bamboo covered house, its walls composed of a
few sticks stuck up at intervals. The entire
inside had on its dress of mourning from the
smoke from the family cook-stove, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a pile of rocks in one corner. While the
woman was making us a fresco of gourd seed,
(a favorite drink they make there), grinding the
seeds on the tortilla stone, the old mother pig
and her babies were having a real jubilee under
the rickety table. In that country hogs seem
to be the family pets, for in every house there
are many of them. The beds were merely a few
sticks covered with a rawhide. Other sticks
surmounted by a rough board served for a table,
and a black smutty pile of rocks was the stove.
These articles completed the home furnishings.
The host was poor, but oh, how he and his family
listened to the Gospel story! This is the picture
of thousands of homes in that country. The
people are exceedingly poor, but hungry for the
Bread of Life. How we enjoyed preaching the
Gospel to them! Although there were numerous
hardships to endure, it was sweet to be in God’s
will, and to tell these dear ones of His great love
for, and His desire to save them.</p>

<p>Reaching our next stopping place late in the
evening we camped for the night. After we
women were in our hammocks, and the men
had seen the animals put away for the night, they
went for a swim in a nearby stream. When
their swim was finished, they found the stream
was the home of some large</p>

<p class="center"><b>Alligators</b></p>

<p class="noindent">but, praise God! He is the same as when He
stopped the lions’ mouths for Daniel. Certainly
He does care for His little children.</p>

<p>Rising before daybreak we sent up a thanks-giving
to our Heavenly Father for His safe-keeping
through the night, and asked Him to
protect us that day. Then we loaded our beds
and other belongings upon the mules and went
on our way.</p>

<p>That day’s journey brought us over a part
of the country which was covered with great
rocks and boulders thrown from Nicaragua’s
largest volcano, El Momotombo. In the distance
we could see the volcano belching forth
smoke, and the heat was intense. About one
hundred years ago this volcano completely destroyed
the city of Leon, leaving a great lake
filled with water, which is there today.</p>

<p>The dust was very deep in the roads, because
of the extensive traveling. It rolled up about
us in a great cloud. Many times we could not
see each other a few feet away. We resembled
a miniature whirlwind coming down the road,
and surely we were a whirlwind coming against
the devil. The enemy would fain stir up a
storm to strangle God’s people and prevent
them from invading the territory he has so long
held, but we would not be intimidated. Souls
were at stake. They were being held in prison,
behind bars of iron, but their cries had reached
Heaven and God had sent some of His messengers
with the glad news of freedom. The message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
must be delivered, regardless of the cost,
so over mountain and plain we went, covered
with dust, faint from much traveling through
long, hot days, but on to the people with the
message that Jesus died to set them free.</p>

<p>Toward dusk we came in sight of a little
adobe house, and were told that we might stop
there for the night. How nice it was to see a
place where we could rest our tired bodies, wash
ourselves and comb our hair. For three days
we had been unable to comb our hair or wash
ourselves for water was too scarce. How wonderful
it will be when we earth-travelers pass on
our way to that City which hath foundations,
whose builder and maker is God, where we shall
see dear Jesus and hear Him say, “<b>Come, My
children, into the mansions I have prepared
for you</b>.” The residents of that city “shall
hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither
shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For
the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall
feed them, and shall lead them unto living
fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes.”—Rev. 7:16,17. How
blessed to know Jesus has gone to prepare a
place for us! How the very thought thrills my
soul, and causes me to want to work to help
bring others into those mansions!</p>

<p>While talking with the natives, they told us
that</p>

<p class="center"><b>A Large Tiger</b></p>

<p class="noindent">had come down from the mountains and, after
killing two cows and injuring several more, had
escaped. They were greatly frightened, as the
animal was still in the neighborhood, but we lay
down under the shed, and went to sleep, awakening
just when the sun was coming up through the
trees. We hustled and dressed, and after ordering
some hot milk from the people there, we
mounted for another day’s journey. We went
down the road in the direction which the tiger
had taken. The natives warned us that we
were likely to meet the ferocious animal in the
forest not far away, but we went on, singing the
sweet songs of Zion, and trusting ourselves to
His keeping, who said, “I will give you power
over all the power of the enemy.” A tiger was
a very small thing compared to the awful
monster of sin which had ravaged the whole
country. We realized that the King’s business
demanded haste, so we passed on, and rode over
the dusty road unmolested. The blessed Holy
Spirit filled our hearts with joy at the thought
of soon reaching the place where we should have
meetings with the dear faithful little band of
Christians who were awaiting.</p>

<h2 id="OUR_ARRIVAL_IN_LEON">OUR ARRIVAL IN LEON</h2>

<p>Our arrival in the city aroused much curiosity
among the people. As we passed through the
streets they came out of their houses and followed
us to see where we were going. When we
came in sight of the house where lived a Christian
woman, who had suffered much at the
hands of her people, she came out to meet us.
The power fell on her, and she danced for joy,
and we wept and shouted. A crowd soon gathered
to see what had occurred, and we had a meeting
right there, telling them of the Savior’s love
and His willingness to save them from all sin, and
to present them faultless before His Father. These
people had persecuted this dear sister for ten years
after she was saved. They would come and whip
her, throw her goods into the street, and tell her
they would kill her if she did not turn back into
the Roman church, but she stood true, and now
had the Baptism of the Spirit, and in her house
we had our meetings.</p>

<p>We slept on cow hides for beds, with a straw
mat under us. We ate our food out of gourds for
two weeks until our things came and we could
get a house. It was sweet to be in the Master’s
dear service.</p>

<p class="caption">Street Scene in Leon</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The city of Leon is anti-American because it
is the headquarters of the Liberal party, which
is trying to overthrow the rule of the church of
Rome. The United States appointed a president<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
twelve years ago, thus stopping the revolution
then in progress. As the president is a
church man the Liberal party hasn’t much love
for an American.</p>

<p>This was a difficulty which we had before us.
Not only were missionaries hated, but we were
American missionaries, which was far worse.
We looked to the Father for a house in which we
might live, and preach the Gospel to these dear
people. A man came to us and said we could
have a house, so we moved in the following day.
It was a poor thing to call a house, being dirty,
and infested with scorpions, lizards, and a
species of ant which builds a big mud house
and eats not only one’s clothes but also the
furniture.</p>

<p>We were situated between two saloons and
houses of ill-fame, right in the slum district.
People danced, drank and caroused all night
in these places. It was a pretty good place in
which to open fire on the enemy, being right in
the midst of his works. When an army advances
to fight the enemy it goes to the strongest point.</p>

<p>On one side of our house, which was built of
thin lumber, there were cracks in the wall, and we
could look through the cracks into the saloon.
We remembered the scripture which says we
are not to light a candle and put it under a
bushel, but on a candle stick, so all can see;
so we would get out our little organ and sing
and play, then kneel and pray, and the people
would peep through at us. We were told they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
might throw rocks at us, and burn down the
house, and might even kill us, but we were not
there to draw back, so we opened fire with the
heavy artillery of God’s power in the Holy
Ghost.</p>

<p>We had not had, as yet, any public meetings,
but had been waiting on the Lord for guidance.
One morning there appeared a woman in our
doorway, crying out</p>

<p class="center"><b>“Will You Come and Pray for My
Baby? It Is Dying!”</b></p>

<p>We went with her to her home, which was a
few doors away. There on the bed lay a little
child, seemingly just passing away. A crowd had
gathered about the door. When I saw the baby
and that crowd there arose a cry to God from
the depths of my soul to heal the child, thereby
proving His power to the people. The child
seemed to pass away, but we called on God to
heal it for His glory. The little thing rose up,
climbed off the bed, and began playing on the
floor.</p>

<p>The mother shouted and gave herself to the
Lord then and there. The doctors had given
the child medicine to make it die easy, for it
had been sick a long time. The mother brought
the baby to our house, and sang, and praised
the God of Heaven until the people from far
and near came to see the child. She afterwards
took the child and went all over the city
from house to house telling how God had healed
it and saved her. Then the people began to
come to be prayed for. Often they would
come and stay far into the night.</p>

<p>We were having such a blessed time that we
forgot about living in the slums, and about the
saloons on either side of us, although at first
we could not sleep for the noise from them.
Soon we discovered they had moved the saloon
which was so close to our bedroom. When I
saw the proprietor come into the meetings, with
others who came for prayer, I asked him if he
had moved. He answered he had, as he did
not feel good to have a bar so close to where
we prayed so much. Besides, he said, he had
no customers left, as they all came to hear us.
Hallelujah! Jesus did move in a mighty way.</p>

<p>On the other side was the biggest house of
ill-fame in the city. Men and women gathered
there by dozens, some of them perfectly nude,
dancing and drinking at all hours of the night.
It was so awful we felt that hell had been uncapped
in that place. But here came the
“madame” to us, asking for prayer, saying she
was sick, and she knew she was living a bad life.
After her came many others. We prayed with
each one and gave them each a Bible, until
there were some mighty changes wrought in
that section of the city.</p>

<p class="center"><b>One Dark Night</b></p>

<p class="noindent">when the rain was falling in torrents, we were
sitting around our feeble candle-light, reading
our Bibles. We heard a knock on the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
It was late, and we had been warned by both
missionaries and the Christian natives, to be
very careful to whom we opened our doors
after night, as there were people who would as
soon kill us as they would an animal, so we did
not open the door immediately. The knocking
continued, and we heard a man’s voice asking
us in Spanish to let him in. My husband partly
opened the door, and in the small opening we
saw a tall, dark native. He pushed into the
room, looking very much frightened. When we
asked what he wanted, he asked if we were the
missionaries. We told him that we were, and
he told us that five years before he had found a
Bible, and began reading it. He had become
convinced of the truth of the Gospel and wished
to talk with us. We talked and prayed with
him, then asked him to come to the meetings.
He said his mother was very angry because he
did not go to the church any more, and he was
afraid that if he were to come to our meetings
the people would kill him. That was why he
had come on such a dark, wet night to have a
talk with the missionaries. We were reminded
of the ruler in Israel who interviewed Jesus in
the night.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>He came to the house every night for two
weeks. When we opened our class in English he
attended. We always had a lesson from the
Bible, and the scholars had to learn scripture
verses. One day this man came out boldly and
said, “I am coming to the meetings.” By this
time we had several of the leading citizens of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
city attending our meetings. This young man
has since been called to preach the Gospel to his
people. Pray for him. The following is a copy
of a note he wrote us when we left Leon.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am returning your book. I thank you so much for
it. It has been a great blessing to me. Please pray for
me, as I feel a call to preach the Gospel. Send me Bibles
and tracts from your land for my people.”</p></div>

<p>Others came to the class, being anxious to
learn English. The judge of the city, doctors,
lawyers, and many others heard the Gospel
preached. To one young man who came to
the class we gave a Bible in English, and one
day he came to ask us some questions. The
priests had told the natives we were nice people
but were teaching error, for we taught people to
read the Bible and the Bible was a very bad
book, and they must not read it. But this
precious boy was convicted of sin, and was
seeking God. We asked him to pray the Lord
to forgive his sins, and then to believe that God
did it. He asked for a prayer-book, so he could
pray. We told him we never used prayer-books;
we simply asked God to forgive us and save us
from our sins. He was sweetly saved and went
away to bring a cousin to the meetings. This
cousin was also saved. These two were among
our brightest pupils. They could read and
speak English quite well in a few months.</p>

<p>One morning, very early, before we were up,
there came a knock on our door and a little
brown-faced Indian girl appeared. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
about thirteen years old, and very pretty. She
asked us to take her as a servant. She had
nowhere to go, and had been sleeping in the
market. As I looked at that dear little brown
face and heard her story I looked up to my
Heavenly Father and breathed a prayer that
He would remember the thousands who, like her,
had no home and were perishing. We told her
we would take her, and I wish my readers might
have seen that dear little face light up with joy
because she would have a home with the missionaries.
She was a very bright girl, and very
quick to learn. Soon she could play the organ
and sing the Gospel hymns. How she did love
to go to the meetings and to read her Bible!</p>

<p class="center"><b>Carl’s Ball and Bat</b></p>

<p>Carl had a ball and a bat which had been
brought from the homeland, and in the daytime
he would go out into the small park near the
house, gather all the boys from the streets, and
play ball with them. They had never seen a
ball or a bat before, and it was all very wonderful
to them. Carl’s face would become very red
from the heat, and the children thought it queer
to see a red-faced boy with such white hair, and
such peculiar things as the ball and bat. He
would play with them until lunch-time, then
they would come home with him, and he would
get his Bible, read from it, and tell them of
Jesus, and numbers of them were brought to
God in this way.</p>

<p>Many boys and girls came to us asking for a
school and a home, but I am sorry to say that
we could not possibly take them in, our house
and means would not permit. But we are asking
God to stir up the people in the homeland to
give till there shall be a home and school opened
in this dark city of Leon where these precious
jewels may be gathered in and taught the Bible,
and the way to God.</p>

<p>We were having precious meetings, and one
day a man came saying he had walked a long
distance to find the missionaries, to get them to
come to his home and teach the Gospel. Husband
and I went with him, going as far as possible
on the little railroad, then walking the rest
of the way. When we arrived we felt as if
every drop of our blood were boiling, we were so
hot, walking so far under the tropical sun. We
found the family gathered to hear the Word of
God, and thought of Peter going to the house of
Cornelius.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The Lord touched these dear hearts with His
love in a mighty way. They wept, and cried
to Him to save them. Even the little children
were hungry to seek the Lord. Far away from
all Christians, in a dark land, filled with idols,
where the powers of darkness fill the very air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
were those precious souls, just waiting for someone
to come and tell them of a Savior’s love.
There are many thousands just like them. Dear
reader, what will you do to get the gospel to
them? Ask the Lord to show you what He
would have you do.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the scene when we started
to leave these people. They clung to us, begging
us not to leave them. But there were our
own dear children at Leon, in a foreign land, far
away from all loved ones, and with no one to
protect them, and the shadows of night were
beginning to fall. We had to pull ourselves
away from those pleading, soul-hungry people,
and say good-bye. We promised to come back
when we could, telling them we must go back to
our little ones, and the work in Leon. The
father and mother had seven bright-faced boys,
and asked us if we would take them into our
school, and we told them we would if we could
but we were not able for lack of means.</p>

<p>Returning it seemed as if the slow train would
never get to Leon. We were tired, and our feet
were blistered from the long walk in the terrible
heat. But as we looked to the Lord to refresh
our bodies and heal our sore feet, the Holy
Spirit came sweeping through our beings, so
refreshing us that we hardly knew we had gone
through such an ordeal.</p>

<p>In a few days there came a call to another
home far away in the mountains, where the
people were begging that the Gospel be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to them. I took a native woman with me and
we traveled on the train as far as we could go.
We purposed going to the home of some native
Christians who lived in that town, and
who had been in the meetings at Leon, where
we thought to rest until the sun went down, as
the other trip had taught me not to walk far
under the hot sun. As we passed down the
street I heard the people calling out in Spanish,
“Hay una Evangelista!” (There is a missionary!)
But I thought nothing of it, knowing they were
not accustomed to seeing foreigners walking
through their streets.</p>

<p>Arriving at the house of the Christians I was
told the people would not allow missionaries to
come to that town. Some months before, one
of their young men had been converted. When
he came back and told it, men, women, and
children, with the priests as leaders, gathered,
and cut him to pieces in the street near the
house where we then were.</p>

<p>The dear native Christians were looking for
the people to come at any moment and kill
them. They declared that we all would be
killed that day. I began praying to find out
if I had missed the Lord’s will by coming there,
but the Lord spoke to my heart, saying all would
be well and not to fear what the people might
do. So we gathered inside and prayed to God
for protection, and to convict the people of their
awful crimes. When we arose from prayer a
large crowd was gathered outside, watching us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The house was made of small poles stuck in the
ground, with large cracks all around, so we could
easily see and be seen.</p>

<p>We planned to leave the house at sunset, to
walk out to the farm where we were going to
preach the Gospel. I told the dear ones not to
fear, but to trust God. However, they were
greatly frightened and said the mob would certainly
kill me when I went out. But I knew I
had been sent there by the Lord, and all would
be well.</p>

<p>I went out and spoke to the crowd, and then
started down the street, leading to the country.
When I looked around only my woman was with
me. She told me the others had gone another
way, hoping to miss the crowd, which I saw was
following us. I saw some women give a boy a
machette, and tell him to cut me with it. He
came running toward me, talking in Spanish as
fast as he could, and swearing at me. I went
right ahead. He kept at my side, swearing.
The mob followed us. We walked on until we
came to where the road left the town, and turned
into the country. I felt the power of God coming
upon me in a way I had never felt before.</p>

<p>The veins of my neck swelled, and my body
began to shake. Then I turned toward the mob
and began speaking to them in tongues. They
turned and ran, until not one was to be seen. A
little disappointed feeling came into my heart.
I said, “Jesus, I wanted to die a martyr for you
here in this dark land, but now the mob is gone.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
The power still filled my being, until I could do
nothing but worship God. The native Christians
came up. They said they had seen the people
run, and heard them exclaim that fire fell from
Heaven and burned them, until they could
endure it no longer, and they had to run. I did
not see the fire, but felt it burning in my soul in
a mighty way.</p>

<p class="center"><b>At The Farm</b></p>

<p>I preached and sang until midnight, and still
the people begged me to tell them more “good
news” as they called it. Truly it was good news
of great joy to those poor people who had so
long been under the heavy yoke of the enemy.
There was a family of fifteen, also several hired
men, besides about twelve travelers who had
stopped for the night. They had only one room.
When I told them I could not preach any more
that night, but must have some rest for my
body, and a place where I could lie down, they
all went into the room—family, travelers, hired
men, some thirty people in all. They took two
young calves and three small deer with them,
also several hens with their little chicks.</p>

<p>I decided not to sleep with all those people
and animals in that room, with no ventilation—as
the adobe houses are built without any
windows. I told them to fix me a cot outside
in the corridor. They said wild animals came at
night, and I must not sleep outside. But I
decided I would almost prefer being eaten by wild
animals to being smothered. As I insisted, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
put a cot for me outside, and I did not awaken
to see whether any wild animals came. If any
came, they did not molest me.</p>

<p>Arising next morning I ate my breakfast off
of banana leaves, then gathered the family for
prayer. How the power of God did fall and fill
every hungry heart! After prayer I told them
I must leave them, and return home. We gathered
our blankets together, and climbed into the
ox cart which had been brought to carry us to
the railroad station. I was too tall for the
cowhide covering, which was intended to protect
us from the sun, so I sat in the back and let
my feet hang down over the end, and so rode to
town. We sang and talked all the way, about
the love of Jesus. Several times we stopped at
houses by the roadside and preached to the
people, giving them tracts and Bibles.</p>

<p>A large crowd was at the station waiting for
the train. I went to the platform and spoke to
the crowd. They asked me to give them Bibles
and tracts. Some of them were members of the
mob which the night before had been ready to
kill us for coming into their town to preach the
Gospel.</p>

<p>We arrived at Leon very tired and needing
rest. But there were so many to be ministered
unto and the needs were so great that I went
right into the meetings, where God blessed my
soul and rested my body.</p>

<p class="center"><b>The Lord Rolled the Sea Away</b></p>

<p>One day a young man who had been in the
United States, came to see us. He spoke English
well, also had been in different churches and
had some knowledge of the Gospel. He came
many times to read and pray with us. One day
he asked if we would not go to the beach for a
day’s outing. We felt we could not spare the
time, and it would be too much of a luxury for
us. But as he insisted on bringing his machine
and taking us, we consented to go and prepared a
little lunch. Before going we asked if we might
preach to the people on the road. He consented,
so we went for the day, taking Bibles and tracts
with us. Many were the precious souls to whom
we spoke about the Lord Jesus, giving them the
little printed messengers. Our hearts were
moved with compassion as we saw the extreme
poverty of the poor people out in the country,
with no one to love or help them. The
roads were almost impassable and the heat was
intense, but at last we saw the white-caps dashing
up against the shore, and felt the cool breeze
from the ocean. We stopped some distance
from the water and walked down to the beach.
Many Indians were there. Some could not
speak Spanish, but had a sign language. We
spoke to all who could understand us, and they
told the rest about the Gospel, for although they
spoke Spanish, they also understood the sign
language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a dressing place for bathers and a
stand where refreshments were sold by the
Indians, who could not speak Spanish. I sat
down in the shade while the rest went bathing
in the surf. Suddenly I was startled by the
screams of my daughter, Alma. She and the
young man were quite a distance out in the
breakers. They were drowning, and calling for
help. I saw them go under. My husband was
trying to reach them, but the strong undercurrent
took him down also. I prayed and
called on God to save them.</p>

<p>Running to the Indians, I tried to tell them
to run with a rope and save them. I could not
make them understand, but suddenly began
talking in tongues, with signs, which I afterwards
learned was their language. They told
the young man that I had implored them to
help save my daughter, husband and himself.
They ran to help Alma and the young man, but
they could not be seen. I started in that direction
calling on the Lord to save them. The
sea rolled up in a great heap, and there they
were on the sand. How it all happened I cannot
tell. But I know the Lord rolled the sea
away, and they were saved. They were filled
with water and Alma was sick. But the Lord
soon delivered her. The young man knew the
Lord had saved them from death. He was an
expert swimmer, but could not swim in that
strong undercurrent, which had drawn them
so far out before they realized the danger.</p>

<p>How we did praise God for His wonderful
deliverance! It was a mighty miracle, which
convinced the Indians that God had delivered,
for they saw the waters rolled up in a heap. It
made them believe. The news of the wonderful
miracle God had performed for the missionaries
soon spread about the city. It was published
in the papers, and many who had not come before,
came to see us and were convinced of the Gospel.
Many people came from all parts of the
Republic to hear the Gospel, and to ask for
Bibles.</p>

<p>The dear saints in the homeland sent us
Bibles, Testaments and tracts, and the Word of
God went forth. We cannot tell how many
precious souls were reached by the bread cast
on the waters, but we shall know when we reach
the beautiful land beyond, and see their dear
faces shining with heavenly glory. We are told
to sow beside all waters, and are promised that
“<b>he that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing
precious seed, shall doubtless come again
with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
him</b>.” Psalm 126:6.</p>

<p>Many were the nights and times we went
forth weeping over the sheep that were out of
the fold, lost among the idols, vice and sin of
every kind. It was almost more than we could
bear when so many of the people came to us,
and we were unable to take them all in and help
them. We could only weep and cry to the Lord
to help us to reach them, and to stir up the saints
at home to give all they possibly could to aid in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
helping them. For this purpose we are sending
forth this book, that funds may be raised to
send Bibles and tracts to these people.</p>

<p>It was at this time, when many were pressing
upon us for help and our means were so limited
that God told us to return to the homeland and
tell the church of the great need of sending more
Bibles, tracts and missionaries to these destitute
fields. As we looked to the Lord and told Him
we did not have the money to get back home,
He spoke and told us we were to pack up and
go to the port, and He would send the money
for us there for our fare. So we began making
ready.</p>

<p>Another missionary and his wife came by,
going home on furlough. They were going via
Guatemala, believing they could save quite a
sum of money by going that way. But the
Lord had told us to go via Panama. We packed
our trunks and made ready. But oh, how we did
hate to tell our dear people we were leaving them,
for we loved them so, and they loved and clung
to us. We knew they would feel so badly to
have us leave them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>When we went to the meeting that night we
told them the Lord had led us to return to our
homeland, to put the great needs of their
country before the people. They cried, both
men and women, and pressed upon us until we
thought we could never get ready to start. I
had to put our suit-cases in a room and lock the
doors so I could finish packing, for the house was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
full of precious souls begging to hear more of
the Gospel, and telling us how much they loved
us, and what a great blessing we had been to
them. Our hearts were breaking over the
people, for they were as sheep without a shepherd.
May God bless and keep them true to
Him.</p>

<p>We were packed and ready to go to the train
when there came a big procession of people
marching into the house. Some of them we
had not met before, and some we had seen on
the streets and in the markets, when we were
preaching and giving out tracts. Many of them
had come to our meetings, had heard and accepted
the Gospel, and had been filled with the
blessed Holy Spirit. They brought many presents,
among them a nice leather bill-book
for my husband, a manicuring set for Alma,
pretty fans for me, and boxes of candy for Carl.
Many useful presents they brought, some of
which had cost much money, for everything is
much more expensive there than in our country.
Even rich people had come and brought presents
to show their appreciation of our missionary
work among them.</p>

<p>When the train pulled in, and we were about
to go on board, several doctors and lawyers and
the judge of the city came, saying they were
going to the port with us to stay until our ship
sailed, and there was the crowd standing outside
waving their hands and saying, “Good-bye, don’t
forget to pray for us, and send us Bibles.” Oh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
that scene! We shall never forget it. As the
train started the people hung on to the side,
waving their hands, and calling “Good-bye, our
good missionaries; we love you so much.”</p>

<p>We had many opportunities to witness for
Jesus and to give out literature on the way
to the port. The people were so hungry they
would run and beg for more tracts.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the port station we were
taken to a hotel by one of the men who had gone
with us, and there a fine dinner was given us in
a special dining room, and we had a nice time.</p>

<p>We found we must appear before the American
consul twice a day for several days before sailing,
as we had come from a yellow fever infected
region. We began to go that morning,
for the ship bound for Panama would
come in seven days.</p>

<p>We made ready to leave on that boat, but
there was no money for the fare. As I prayed
in my room one morning the Lord said, “Go and
ask for your mail.” I thought, “I don’t believe
the mail is opened here, but on arriving in the
port is immediately sent to the different parts of
the country.” But as I prayed again the Lord
spoke once more, “Go and ask for your mail.”
I knew it was the voice of the Lord, for He had
wonderfully spoken to us and led us all the way,
so I went. On asking for the mail I was told
that no mail was coming for two weeks, and
when it did come it would not be opened there
but would be sent out to the different parts of
the republic.</p>

<p>I returned to my room, wondering. I believed
the Lord had sent me for our mail, but
why had the postal officials said it could not be
obtained there? Besides, there was no mail
boat coming until after the other boat had sailed.
But as I prayed I heard the voice of the Lord
telling me to go again and ask for my mail. I
waited until the next morning, then went again.
Once more the postmaster told me the same thing,
that it would be impossible for me to get my mail
there when it did come. I must admit that
I felt at a loss to know what to do, or what
it all meant. But I couldn’t doubt the voice of
the Lord. I waited another day, and prayed
until I was sure the Lord was speaking to me.
Though I couldn’t see how it all could work out,
yet I knew that He knew, and had spoken.</p>

<p>I went again to the postmaster and explained
to him that we were sailing on the ship which
was then in the harbor, and which was to leave
in three days, but again he told me the same
thing; there would be no mail boat in for two
weeks, and it would be impossible to receive my
mail before that time. I returned to my room
and, falling upon my face, I cried to the Lord for
help, for this seemed more than I could bear, for
the enemy was taunting me, saying that the Lord
was not speaking to me, that we had been deceived,
that the Lord had not even told us to
come to the port, and that our fare would certainly
not be provided. Nevertheless, the voice
of the Lord came again to me, saying, “Ask for
your mail tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>When we arose the next morning we saw
another ship at anchor in the port. It had come
in during the night. My husband strolled down
to the dock, and was informed that this was the
mail boat from Panama, also that our ship was
not to sail until the following day, because the
cargo was not yet unloaded. When he returned
with the welcome news I began to pray again
about the mail, feeling certain there was something
for us on that ship. Then I went again to
see the postmaster, this time taking a Testament
to give him. This seemed the wrong thing to
do, for he was a fanatical church man, and the
Gospel was not allowed to be preached in that
port. But we had gone unmolested all over the
place, distributing tracts, and preaching to the
people, and the dear natives had begged for
Bibles and the little papers (tracts).</p>

<p class="caption">Alma with her music class in Leon</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Walking up to the office window, I told the
man the Lord had spoken to me, telling me there
was mail there for me, which had come in on
that ship. He came to the window, began talking
about the Lord, and asked me how I knew
the Lord had said there was mail there for us.
I answered that we had come to port in order to
sail on the ship then in harbor, that we did not
have our fare, but the Lord had told us the fare
would be provided after we reached the port. I
was sure there was mail for us there, and would
he please give it to me? Handing him the Testament,
I told him to read it, and learn about the
wonderful Savior who could come into our
hearts and talk to us, and lead us in such straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
paths. He began to weep, and told me he had
never before seen a Bible, had hated and persecuted
the missionaries, had hated me when I
came inquiring for mail, and had not even believed
in God before; but my coming so many
times, saying the Lord had told me there was mail
coming for me, in spite of my knowing that the
mail ship was not due for two weeks, then the
arrival of the mail ship before time, and the
postponed sailing of the other vessel upon which
I said we were to sail, had convinced him that
God was actually speaking to me, and he promised
to try to get our mail. However, there
were thousands of letters, and he was rather
doubtful if he could find our mail in the midst of
so much other, but promised that if I would return
in the afternoon he would do his best for
me. In the afternoon, I returned for the mail,
which I was sure would be there. The man
came hurrying to me, and handed me two registered
letters, saying they were on the top of the
pile of mail in the first bag he opened. Surely
God had spoken to me, he said, and he knew
now there was a God, and he was going to serve
Him, so as to have Him speak to him, too. And
very earnestly he promised to read the Testament,
also he asked for a Bible for his wife,
and tracts for his friends.</p>

<p>When I opened the two letters there, lacking
twenty-five dollars, was the amount for our fare.
We sailed the following morning. Later I went
into my stateroom to find out the exact amount
of money we had, to make sure how much was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
lacking for the entire trip to the homeland. Sure
enough, there was exactly twenty-five dollars
lacking. Again I looked to the dear Lord for
help to believe for the needed amount, and again
He spoke, telling me to open my Bible. I did so,
and my eyes fell upon this scripture:</p>

<p><b>“And the Lord, He it is that doth go
before thee; He will be with thee; He will
not fail thee, neither forsake thee; fear
not, neither be dismayed.”</b>—Deut. 31:8</p>

<p>Looking at the little scripture calendar hanging
on the wall I saw in the space for the day on
which we would land in Panama the identical
verse I had just read. Strengthened and encouraged
by this, I felt that Jesus would make
it all right, and that we were simply to trust and
obey.</p>

<p>Upon arriving in Panama we were taken to
the American Bible House, where we were treated
with the greatest kindness. Dear Mr. Duffey
and his wife gave us much valuable information
about the whole of Central America, as they
were in touch with every mission station, and
had themselves been missionaries there for many
years.</p>

<p>We had to wait three days for the ship to New
Orleans, and we sweetly rested in the Lord and
trusted Him to supply that twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p>One day we met a young Mexican on the
street, whom we had known in Nicaragua. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was a traveling salesman from St. Louis, Mo.
We had given him a Bible and talked to him
about giving his heart to the Lord, and he had
been very much interested in our work in
Nicaragua. We invited him to visit us at the
Bible House, and in the evening he came. We
read the Word of God and had prayer, and he
told us of his having persecuted the missionaries
in Mexico. He had never seen a Bible before
he met us, but in the United States he had learned
that missionaries did a good work among the
people, so he no longer hated them. He said
he was glad to have met us and heard us preach
the Gospel. “In return for this Bible which you
have given me,” he said, “and the way in which
you have talked to me, I feel I should do something
for you, and the Lord,” and he passed
twenty-five dollars across the table to me.
Praise the Lord! there was the rest of our fare
home. Surely God does temper the wind to
the shorn lamb, and take care of His little ones,
leading them in and out where they can find
pasture.</p>

<p>We sailed the next day. Many were the
precious souls reached by us with the Gospel
while we were in Panama; also on land and on
sea after we left there. Shall we not praise God
forever for all His goodness to us, and for the
privilege of being called to preach to the nations
of the earth?</p>

<h2 id="LEAVING_NICARAGUA_FOR_PANAMA">LEAVING NICARAGUA FOR PANAMA</h2>

<p>We sailed on the Steamship San Juan. After
placing our things in the stateroom we went on
deck and sat down. A little South American
woman came over to me and asked, “Are you a
missionary?” I told her I was. “Well,” she
said, “I thought you must be a missionary, for
no one else would be away down here so far
away from their homeland.”</p>

<p>She had been in the States studying to be a
nurse, and had been saved through a Salvation
Army meeting on the street. She took my arm
and said, “Come right over here. There is a
poor blind man from Salvador, and he badly
needs help.”</p>

<p>We thanked God, for here was another chance
to cast our bread upon the waters, another
hungry soul reaching out for the truth.</p>

<p>We took some tracts and Testaments and
went over to the man. He said he had heard a
traveling missionary preach the Gospel several
years ago in his own country, and had longed to
know more about it; now here we were to tell
him. So he praised the Lord, and we wept and
told him Jesus loves us so much that He never
fails to answer the prayer of an honest soul.</p>

<p>We gave him a Testament and some tracts
on Salvation and Divine Healing and the dear
little woman read them to him. Day after day
he asked for more to be read to him. The woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
asked if we could not give her some to take
home to Ecuador to her people.</p>

<p>There was only one man on the ship who did
not take tracts and read them and ask for more.
This man said he had not read the Bible since he
was a child. Now he was too old. As we looked
at him and saw the hardness in his face, a
great pity came into our hearts, and we asked
the Lord to have mercy on him and save him.</p>

<p>We arrived in one port in Costa Rica on September
15th, Spain’s Independence Day. The
whole country was celebrating. Our ship would
have to wait here several days, perhaps a week,
the captain said, because all the people got
drunk on that day, and it would take several
days for them to sober up. We arrived at six
in the morning. The noise from the cannon
and other things was terrible. We knew about
how much time we had to make connections in
Panama, and that we could not stay in this port
over one day without missing connections. So
we prayed that God would make these people
unload the ship that day so that we might go on.</p>

<p>At twelve, when we were having lunch, our
ship was moving out to sea. The men had come
with their lighters and unloaded several tons of
the cargo, and we were on our way. The dear
old man who would not read the tract, ate at our
table. He said he had lived there and in
Panama for fifty years, and that was the first
time he ever knew them to do such a thing. He
knew it was because we prayed. So God was
good not to leave him without a witness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>A man and his wife were going to South
America. They took tracts and Testaments
along which we gave them, and said they were
glad to have the light on the Second Coming of
the Lord, and on Divine Healing.</p>

<p>There were people on board who were going
to Japan, China, India, England and the United
States. All took with them the Word of God
which we had cast upon the waters. Two
young men on their way to school in New York,
took along Testaments to read. They said
they no longer believed in the Church of Rome,
and wanted to read the Bible.</p>

<p>Another boy on his way to South America
came to talk with us about the Bible. He said
he wanted to read the Bible but had never had
the opportunity. So he sat on deck and read it.
How he did rejoice to know the truth! He told
us how he had gone to the different temples of
the idols and saints seeking peace, but had
come away from them all without receiving any
help. But now he knew the truth, and wanted
to carry the good news to his people who were
still in the darkness. He said, “Why don’t
more missionaries come and tell us the truth?
Won’t you go back to your homeland and tell
them of our needs and the darkness we are in?”</p>

<p>Stewardesses, waitresses, captains and officers
all heard the story of the Gospel, through the
bread we cast upon the waters. One officer said
he was glad that someone thought of the men
at sea. They were always going and had no time
to attend church and hear the Gospel. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
had Christian parents, but they were dead. His
heart was touched and with tears running down
his cheeks he said, “May God bless you for giving
me this Testament. I shall read it, and pray
every day, as I want to meet my dear mother
in Heaven.” He had been at sea twelve years,
and that was the first time anyone had said a
word to him about salvation.</p>

<p>The doctor on the ship was so interested he
would leave his office for hours and come and
talk with us. He had been on that line many
years and he had been shocked to see the condition
in the Latin-American countries, and the
church at home seemed to be doing nothing.
He took tracts and papers and talked with us
about prophecy. He said he knew the Lord
was coming soon. We invited him to meetings
with us at Colon. He came to the Bible House
and to the meetings and said he was going to
a Pentecostal meeting when he returned to the
States.</p>

<p>While in Panama we visited the Sea Wall
M. E. Church, where there is a work among the
natives. But all who come to the school have
to pay. That leaves the poor population wholly
untouched by the Gospel. We looked over the
field and found it a great white harvest field,
where laborers are badly needed. In all these
parts the people are hungry for the Gospel.</p>

<p>There is a little union church in Colon in
which a few people are praying for a revival.
It is a wonderful opportunity for a band of
workers to go and hold evangelistic meetings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
There are many English-speaking people in
these parts, but Pentecost has not been preached.
We believe God will raise up workers and send
them to this place. Besides the people who
live here, there are hundreds of ships coming
and going to all parts of the world. Many souls
could be reached.</p>

<h2 id="SAILING_FROM_PANAMA">SAILING FROM PANAMA</h2>

<p>Finding a ship that was to sail for New
Orleans we went aboard and set forth, carrying
with us many more tracts and Testaments so
that we might cast bread upon the waters among
other people.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving the port I noticed a man on
board whom we had met in another place. He
was a gambler, who traveled and gambled on
ships all the time. We had spoken to him of
the Bible and about the Lord, but he had said
he did not think anyone ought to talk about the
Bible and religion, as such talk would make
people lose their minds. We were only
getting people stirred up, and that wasn’t good.
I heard him tell the captain we were missionaries,
and that wherever we went we talked
about God and the Bible, but he hoped we would
not be allowed to do so on this trip.</p>

<p>Some of the people looked so very aristocratic
that the enemy said to me, “You had better not
give out tracts and Testaments on this boat, as
the people will not listen, for they will think you
are a fanatic.” But I felt I must let my light
shine here as well as in other places. So I went
to my stateroom to pray. I opened my Bible to
read and saw in it a little tract, containing these
words:</p>

<p><b>“Have you overcome the worldly opinions
of the sect which is everywhere spoken
against by taking your stand with it?
What would Jesus have you do? Have you
done that? If the world has nothing to
say against you, Jesus will have nothing to
say for you. His grace is sufficient. Ask
Him.”</b></p>

<p>That was a message to my heart. I said, “Lord,
I will go through this ship and give out tracts to
everyone. Now, Lord, you bless every dear
heart, and open to them the Gospel.”</p>

<p>As I passed around the deck giving out tracts,
a man and his wife asked what church I belonged
to. I told them I belonged to</p>

<p class="center"><b>“The Church of the First Born.”</b></p>

<p class="noindent">Then I told them about the Pentecostal people,
and how we had received the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit, as the people did on the day of
Pentecost, and told them that God was pouring
out His Spirit on the earth, and that Jesus was
coming again soon. They were Seventh-Day
Adventist missionaries from Colombia, South
America, coming home on furlough. They
had been on the field four years, but had only
been selling their literature. Nobody had
been saved, but they thought that when,
they went back again they would be able
to do something, as the people would have an
understanding of their religion and the keeping
of the Sabbath Day. We could see their lives
were empty, and that they knew nothing about
worshiping God in Spirit and in truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>We had many talks together about the law of
Moses and the ten commandments. We showed
them we are dead to the law through the body of
Christ, and that we should serve in newness of
Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter. Oh,
how these dear hearts did respond to the Word
of God! They had been reading the many
different books of their denomination, but did
not have a Bible. We asked them to read the
Word of God that would bring Spirit and Life
into their lives and we gave them a nice Bible.
As we separated in New Orleans, they took my
hand and said, “Thank God for sending you on
this ship. We felt empty and dry, and now we
know what is the trouble. We shall read and
pray until we are filled with the blessed Holy
Spirit, and when we return to our mission-field
we can preach the Gospel to the people.”</p>

<p>A family coming from South America took
tracts and Testaments and called for more.
They said they were Lutherans, had been raised
in that church, felt a lack in their lives,
and wanted to have the power and glory of God
in their souls. They believed that Jesus was
coming soon.</p>

<p>Every time we went into the parlor and sat
down we had a congregation, for the poor
people were so hungry they would come and ask
us to tell them more about this wonderful way.</p>

<p>A great hurricane was sweeping the Gulf. A
wireless message had been received that the
storm was terrible, and warning us to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
for it before leaving the port. The blackness
was awful on the waters as we went out. As we
moved slowly out of the inner harbor, some battleships
were having target practice at sea.
Two submarines partly submerged, were slowly
moving along to keep ships from coming too
close to where the sailors were shooting.</p>

<p>The Lord said to me, “Just as those submarines
are placed here to protect the ships
from the shooting, so I will place My angels
around this ship and the storm shall not molest
you.”</p>

<p class="center"><b>“Only believe and rest in Me.”</b></p>

<p>The passengers were frightened, and the captain
gave orders to have the storm doors and windows
put in, and the ship made ready to meet the
terrible hurricane. But on we sailed, and the
storm moved on in front of us, all the way to New
Orleans. Only once did we get into it a little for
a few minutes. The rain came down in floods,
the wind blew with great force, thick darkness
settled down over the ship, and we were tossed
by the great waves that arose. Many became
sea-sick and ran to their staterooms for life-preservers.
The captain gave orders to have
the life boats in readiness.</p>

<p>As we passed into our staterooms, not to get
the little cork-and-canvas life preservers that
were lying there, but to get in touch with the One
Great Life-Preserver, who said He would give
His angels charge over us, there came into our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
hearts a sweet rest and peace. After prayer we
arose and went on deck. As I passed through
the door I met the captain, who said, “I have
been looking for you and your husband, that you
might pray for our ship to be saved, as there is
no other hope.” He himself lifted up his hand
and asked God to drive back the storm. Just
then the blackness swept off the decks, the ship
straightened up, and the sun smiled down upon
us. Surely God giveth His angels charge over us,
that we should not dash our feet against a stone.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou blest Rock of Ages, I’m hiding in Thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From that time on we were sailing just behind
the big black hurricane. A ship that had
been following us was caught in the storm, and
for three days and nights they were lost and
had no hope of being saved. A young man
from this ship rode on the train with us from
New Orleans to St. Louis. He told us of the
terrible things they suffered. How they all
had life-preservers on many times, and were
ready to get into the life-boats, as they thought
the ship would go down.</p>

<p>On our ship every passenger, officer and member
of the crew took tracts and Testaments and
read them. The captain told us he was glad to
have someone on the ship who knew how to
pray. On the previous trip he brought some
women from Colon who were dope fiends. The
whole boat was in a terrible uproar all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
way, and he feared God would let them all go
down for such wickedness. He himself knew
something of the power of God. He took a
Bible and tracts and asked for some of our
books for the ship’s library. Shall we not give
these men some good books to read at sea?</p>

<p>The gambler, whom I heard say we were always
talking about the Lord, came to me and
said, “I want to get some papers and a Bible.
I have always been a wicked man, but since I
have been on this boat I have made up my mind
to give my heart to God and live different.” He
said he had a Christian mother who taught him
to kneel at her knee and say his evening prayer,
and he wanted to meet her in Heaven, for he
knew she was there.</p>

<p>One of the professors from the Northwestern
University was on board. He had been traveling
through all the Latin-American countries, gathering
information for the new history he was
writing. He came to talk with us, saying he was
interested in mission work. We gave him all
the information we could about the different
parts of the country we had visited. He said,
“I know you people have something I haven’t.
What is it?” He was a member of the Presbyterian
church, and had been since he was a very
young child. His father was a minister, so he
had always been brought up in the church.</p>

<p>As we read the Bible to him and prayed with
him, telling him of the great outpouring of the
Spirit of God in these last days, and the soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
coming of Jesus, he wept like a child, and said
he was ready for all God had for him. When he
returned to Chicago he would go to a Pentecostal
mission, as he knew this was the truth of God.
He was a very sweet spirited man, open to the
Spirit of the Lord. He took with him many
tracts on the Baptism of the Spirit and the Second
Coming of Jesus.</p>

<p>A young man, on his way to school in the
States, asked for a Bible, saying he had never
seen one, but had a great desire to read one.
Since hearing us talk so much about it, he
thought it must be a wonderful Book. He took
a Bible to school with him, also tracts and papers.
He was a native of Costa Rica.</p>

<p>As we were leaving the ship at New Orleans
people came for more Testaments and tracts
to carry away with them. One brother and
sister, very wealthy people, traveling for pleasure,
took many of the little messengers, the sister
saying that when she reached her home in
Oklahoma she was going to prepare herself for
missionary work. She was tired of the life
she had been living, and having seen the awful
need of the Central American people, she could
never be happy again until she went to help
them.</p>

<p>In New Orleans we gave out hundreds of
tracts and found many hungry souls. I visited
some of the missions there, in search of
Pentecostal people, but they told us there were
none there. Such a needy city! May the
God of Heaven stir our hearts until we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
awakened and go forth into every city of the
Union with this message of the hour, and the
people are reached and the Holy Spirit is poured
out upon the earth.</p>

<p>On board the train for St. Louis, we found
many hungry hearts ready for the truth, having
never heard it before. In the Union Station,
St. Louis, we found others who were hungry.
They took the tracts and went away pleased to
have them. Even in our own city we found
people who were eager to hear the Word of God.
Many were the precious souls reached by the
Bread upon the waters, which we freely cast forth.</p>

<p>We traveled from Granite City, Illinois, to
Los Angeles, California, giving out tracts and
Testaments. From Los Angeles we sailed to
Central America and gave out the Word in
every port we came to in Mexico, Central
America and Panama. From Panama to New
Orleans and Granite City we distributed the
Word to thousands. We look back over our
journey and see a long white line of Bread that
was cast upon the waters, reaching our home
in Granite City, where also God is working.</p>

<h2 id="THE_NEEDS_OF_CENTRAL_AMERICA">THE NEEDS OF CENTRAL AMERICA</h2>

<p>There is a land not far away. It lies on our
own continent. It is a land of tropical beauty,
where cocoanut palms wave their tall green
branches in the breeze, and where flowers bloom
the year around. The banana, pineapple, orange,
and many other tropical trees and plants
yield their fruit in rich abundance. The chatter
of innumerable parrots and the sweet songs of
many birds are heard from the great tall trees
of the forests. Scantily-clad brown-faced boys
and girls run about. Seeing it, one is made to
say, “What a beautiful country!”</p>

<p>But, ah! As one advances inland, leaving the
pretty harbor of Corinto, on the Pacific coast,
the signs of the enemy’s work are on man and
beast.</p>

<p>There is desolation everywhere. The poor
people are too weak to withstand the strong
rival with whom they have had to battle so
long. Homes are broken up. Mothers with
their little children are crying for help. Their
cries are heard on every side. Powers of darkness
sweep over the whole country.</p>

<p>The poor are driven like animals to the plantations
to work for a few cents a day, not enough
to sustain life. They are paid in advance for
the season’s work. The wage is so small the
family soon spend it all. Then they are arrested
and made to work for what they have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
received. Even mothers are put into the coffee
and banana fields to work in the hot sun. On
the poor tired women go with their babies
strapped to their backs all day long, with nothing
to eat but a tortilla (a corn cake baked
without seasoning of any kind).</p>

<p>In the evening the poor tired people make their
way to their little huts, which are made of a
few sticks driven into the ground and covered
with straw or palm leaves. There they grind
corn for tortillas, the children carrying water in
little buckets made of gourds that grow on trees,
or in a jar made of clay. Their homes are as
dirty as pig-pens, for the animals live in the
house with the family.</p>

<p>As you travel through the country you find
the very poor, who live in the mountains, far
away from the cities, often whole families,
without clothes. If they wear anything at all,
it will be a piece of cloth woven from grass pinned
around their bodies with a thorn, for they never
saw a pin or button. Many boys and girls fourteen
or fifteen years old have never worn clothes.</p>

<p>Both in the cities and in the country women
are beasts of burden, for the women or the
donkeys furnish the transportation, the men do
not work much. The women work in the
markets and little stores, and carry great loads
of sugar, fruit, water, etc., on their heads in
the hot sun. The streets are full of children
that never were in school. They grow up to be
lazy, fight with each other, and steal. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
you have one around who is not saved you have
to keep everything under lock and key.</p>

<p>More than two-thirds of the population are of
illegitimate birth. Men and women live together
and raise families, yet are never married. One
of the difficult things the missionary has to do is
see that they marry and live clean lives.</p>

<p>The priests charge so much money to perform
the ceremony that the poor cannot pay it, so
they live on year after year in this way; but
they have to pay so much to the priests every
year to get them to forgive their sin of adultery,
in that way the Church of Rome gets more from
them than they would to marry them. The priests
prey upon the superstitions of the people to
extract money from them at all points. The
natives’ religion is a mere form of outward exercises.</p>

<p>For over 400 years the whole of Mexico,
Central and South America, as well as the West
Indies, have been under the heavy yoke of
Romanism. The Spaniards came into the country
and, driving the natives at the point of the
sword, baptized them into the Roman Church,
and took away their language and liberty. They
compelled them to carry timber and stone from
inland and build temples for the Roman Church.</p>

<p>In Leon, which is the largest city of the Republic
of Nicaragua, and where we have our
work, there are between seventy and eighty
thousand people and forty-two temples. And
when one sees those old temples almost ready
to tumble down, and covered with moss and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
grass centuries old, one feels that Rome is certainly
coming to the end of herself in these
countries. The people are rising up now and
calling for schools, and for freedom of the press,
and are crying, “Away with the Church! It
has never done anything for us.” Many thousands
are becoming free-thinkers.</p>

<p>Nicaragua is the only Republic of Central
America that has Church and State united. A
great fight is now on for their separation. There
are over one million people in this Republic
alone without the Gospel. Let us pray God to
speed the day when these reforms shall be
wrought and the Gospel be given the people.</p>

<p>Nicaragua saw her first missionary sixteen
years ago. It has been the last of the Republics
to receive the Gospel. The persecutions were
so severe that the missionaries had to leave in
a few weeks. But, thank God! some of the
people accepted the glad news and have stood
true through flood and flame. But there are
very few missionaries there as yet, and thousands
are without the knowledge of a Savior who died
for them.</p>

<p>All these countries are being flooded with New
Thought, Russellism, Christian Science, Theosophy,
and Spiritualism. Many are coming
into these things now, for the people are fast
turning from Romanism. They are like little
hungry birds with wide-open mouths ready to
accept any poisonous thing presented. Are we,
the true followers of Jesus Christ, going to
sleep on and fail to wake up to this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
opportunity? Let us go forth with the old-time
Gospel of Pentecostal power, that will drive the
enemy from the land, and give these dear people
the truth.</p>

<p>At one place where we were having meetings
the people asked us why missionaries had not
come to them before. They said, “We saw the
first one sixteen years ago, but he was so persecuted
he had to leave us in a few weeks, and only
a few heard the Gospel, and we have been in
darkness for so long. Oh, if some one had only
told us before the way of life!”</p>

<p>Many children were brought to us to be placed
in school, so that they might learn to read and
write, and study the Bible. But as yet we have
been unable to open a school. My heart has
been torn as I have seen the little children
growing up in such ignorance, and especially
the young girls. This country, like all other
countries without the Gospel, regards the women
and girls as no more than animals, and they
are the prey to every horrible crime that anyone
wishes to inflict upon them. The little
girls are often sold into lives of shame by their
parents for a few dollars. We knew one mother
who sold her four young daughters. One of
them found that she was to be sold so she ran
away and hid in the mountains, but they hunted
until they found her, then they bound her and
carried her away, dripping with blood where she
had been beaten with clubs and stoned with
stones. The man that took her was, I am sorry
to say, an American. “It is only the precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Blood of Jesus that can change the human
heart, that is deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked.” Jer. 17:9.</p>

<p>Many foreigners have come here for money,
and do not care much how they get it. Some
have gold mines, others have plantations, many
of them are Americans. They are making
every sacrifice for the gold that perisheth.
Shall not we, then, who have the treasure of
Heaven, break the Bread of Life to these dear
hungry souls ere they perish?</p>

<p>There came to us early one morning a bright-faced
Indian girl about thirteen years old. Her
parents were dead, her sisters were living lives
of shame and they had driven the poor little
one out from them. She had been sleeping in
the markets and parks and was crying in the
street. Some one told her to come to us for we
were missionaries and we would help her. She
said she would be our servant and do anything,
that she might have a place where she could be
sheltered from the wicked men. She is only one
of the many thousands that are here in this dark
land crying for some one to help them. Unless
we take them in they will be destroyed by sin.
Many are found dead, having been killed to
hide the crime of some wicked person. It is in
behalf of these suffering ones that this little
message is sent on its way in the Name of Jesus.</p>

<p>We are having blessed meetings. Many are
coming out to hear the good news. Some have
already received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.
A native brother that has been saved has gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
out to another place to preach, and the power
of God is falling. Several have received the
Holy Spirit, and others have been blessed in
soul and healed in body.</p>

<p>Soon after coming into the country God gave
me a vision of the blessed Latter Rain falling all
over Central America. So I ask you, dear child of
the Lord, to pray that the people in the homeland
will be stirred up to come up to the help of
the Lord against the mighty. Many missionaries
have gone to China, India, Africa, and the
Islands of the Sea, but few have come to this
country. Let us awake and pray that the Lord
will send forth laborers, and that the means will
be provided for their support, and that this
very needy land shall hear the blessed Gospel
story. There are a few faithful soldiers of the
cross laboring here, but the battle is hard and
long.</p>

<p>Some have fallen, and their comrades have
laid them away on the green hillside to await
their reward at the coming of the One who said:
“He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathered
fruit unto life eternal.”—John 4:36.</p>

<p>But there is a great door open, and the enemy
is flooding in with all sorts of implements of war.
There is urgent need of more soldiers and supplies.
Just as Uncle Sam was able to send men
and means for the great conflict in Europe, and
so defeat the enemy, so our Captain, who never
lost a battle, is able to send His soldiers, to defeat
the enemy and drive him from the ranks
and to send great showers of blessing upon the

<h2 id="THE_INDIANS_OF_NICARAGUA">THE INDIANS OF NICARAGUA<br />
<span class="smaller">(Extract from Article by Brother Schoenich)</span></h2>

<p>From the time that Gil Gonzaloz de Avile
reached the peaceful shores of the Chontales—Nicaragua—penetrating
to the borders of the
great lakes, the Indian has been made to suffer
from the hands of the so-called enlightened
races. When the above gentleman set his feet
on Nicaraguan soil, the land contained some
3,000,000 peaceful and industrious Indians. In
less than ten years 2,500,000 of them had perished
in battle, were worked to death in the
mines, or had starved in the mountain fastnesses.</p>

<p>In 1529 the Indians revolted, and after six
terrible battles, the Spaniards succeeded in defeating
them; the Indian chiefs were thrown to
bloodhounds, who tore them to pieces. The
masses were subjected to heavy tributes and severe
tasks, and were driven like cattle by their
cruel conquerors. Whoever resisted was ruthlessly
tortured, towns that rebelled were destroyed
and the people put to the sword. The
Indians were reduced to the most abject slavery,
their property was taken, and they were branded
like cattle with hot irons. This cruel practice
prevailed for years, and the miserable remnant
of Indians who were still permitted to live,
moistened their native soil with their bloody
sweat, or dragged out a painful existence in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
mines or gold placers. Coffee, rubber, sugar and
cocoa were not then sought as today.</p>

<p>In 1810, when the first movement toward
freedom began to be realized, an impartial observer
unhesitatingly estimated the entire aboriginal
population of the country at about
90,000 souls. The real Indian is fast going out of
existence. The Ladinos, a class of mixed Spanish
and Indian, soon may be all that is left of the
Indian.</p>

<p>A fear of the white man has been planted in
the Indian by these things. This makes it hard
for the missionary. When one visits their villages,
the children and women run and hide, and
sometimes the men too. Only when one is well
acquainted will they show friendliness. To
reach them, a missionary must live among them,
show them love and kindness and prove by word
and deed that they are their friends, and desire
to bring them to the true light of our Savior
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>These poor Indians are much oppressed. A
planter will make a contract with a man for himself
and oftentimes his woman or wife (they are
seldom married) and all his children, to pick
coffee, etc., giving him money on the contract
for his living. When the planter is ready this
man and his family must appear and work,
gathering the crop, receiving twelve to twenty
cents per day. If he does not appear, soldiers
are sent after him, and he is brought at the point
of the bayonet with his hands tied behind him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and made to work until his debt is paid. The
contract may be made as far as twelve months
ahead, and likely the man has used up all that
his contract calls for. He then seeks work elsewhere,
or even contracts himself to another
planter.</p>

<p>I know a man who has been trying for four or
five years to get free from his “patron,” as the
planter is called. Because he is a good worker
the planter will not release him unless he pays
four or five times more than he owes. The man
is interested in the Gospel. We are praying
God to liberate him and make him a true servant
for our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>May God help the Church of Christ to awake
to see the awful condition of these people, who
are also compelled to pay their church dues by
law and by force. I know a woman who was
back in her church dues. They took all that she
had, which was a few chickens.</p>

<p>Friend, will you not take these dear people on
your heart in prayer and intercession? God can
and does save poor Indians. We have seen His
work in the lives of some. Brother, Sister,
awake! Our Lord is at hand, and what is done
must be done quickly. “Whatsoever He saith
unto you, do it.”</p>

<p>There is also a remnant of Indians in remote
parts of the Republic known as the Suma and
Mosquito tribes. These Indians have not come
under the influence of the Church of Rome.
They do not speak the Spanish language. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
is more English than Spanish spoken among
them. For more than half a century the Moravian
missionaries have worked among them.
They have several missions and churches scattered
along the Atlantic coast, and up some of
the large rivers. The Moravian Mission has
translated the New Testament into the
Mosquito language.</p>

<h2 id="WHERE_IS_THE_WHITE_MANS_BOOK">“WHERE IS THE WHITE MAN’S BOOK
OF HEAVEN?”</h2>

<p>In 1831, four Indian chiefs from Idaho made
their way over the Rockies and were found on
the streets of St. Louis, asking, “Where is the
white man’s Book of Heaven?”</p>

<p>General Clark befriended them, took them
around the city, where they were shown everything
of interest, and they were treated with the
utmost kindness. Finally two of the chiefs fell
ill and died, and when the remaining Indians
were preparing to return to their own tribes, the
general gave a feast for them. At the banquet,
in a farewell address to General Clark and
friends, one of the two Indians poured forth his
burden of sorrow in words of pathetic eloquence,
as follows:</p>

<p>“I came to you over the trail of many moons
from the setting sun. I came with an eye
partly open for my people, who sit in great
darkness, but I go back with both eyes closed.
How can I go back blind to my blind people?
I made my way to you with strong arms, through
many enemies, and through strange lands, that
I might carry back to my people much knowledge,
for my people sent me to get the white
man’s Book of Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;" id="illus43">
<img src="images/illus43.jpg" width="250" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">An Indian woman whose attention was attracted and picture
taken without her knowledge. Indians are very superstitious
and are afraid to have their pictures taken.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“You took me to see many strange things, and
to places where you allow your women to dance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
as we do not ours, but the Book was not there,
and now we are going back the long trail to our
people in the dark land. You make my feet
heavy with many gifts, and my moccasins will
grow old carrying them, but the Book is not
among them. What shall I do? Shall my
people die in darkness? When I go to them,
without the white man’s Book of Heaven, and
tell them I could not get it, they will rise up, one
by one, and go out, to return no more, for it is
for that Book that they have been awaiting my
return. How can I return to my people without
the Book?”</p>

<p>It is said that the city was searched for a
Bible in this man’s language, but there was none
to be found, and the Indians went their way.
This incident was told in a Methodist Episcopal
conference, and an appeal was made for some
to carry the Gospel to the Indians. Two young
men just starting in the ministry were present,
and they arose and said they would go. They
married two lovely young women, and
loaded an ox-wagon with their belongings and
with Bibles translated into the language of the
Indians to whom they were going. Many
weeks of strenuous travel passed before they
reached their destination with the white man’s
Book of Heaven.</p>

<p>The first two white women to cross the
Rockies were these two young brides, with their
husbands. They spent their lives preaching
the Gospel to the Indians, hundreds of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
were brought to Jesus through this faithful
ministry.</p>

<p>Shall we not learn a great lesson from this
story? Shall we not, with all our modern conveniences
and greater opportunities, rise up and
get the message to the great masses of humanity
before Jesus comes?</p>

<p>One time, while preaching to a large crowd of
natives in Central America, I told them of the
great love of God, and how He had saved us,
and put His great love in our hearts which was
why we were there to preach to them and tell
them of that love. When I finished, an old man
arose. He said he was eighty-four years old,
and this was the first time he had heard the
Gospel. Then he asked, “How long have you
people of the United States known of this wonderful
love of God?” I answered that we had
always known of Jesus, that thousands knew of
Him, and were serving Him, and that I had been
saved about fifteen years. The old man then
asked why, if we had known of this great Savior
so long, we had not come sooner to tell his
people about Him, for all his relatives had died,
and had never heard the Gospel. He continued,
“If I had known this Gospel and the wonderful
love and power of God to save us from all sin,
and if you had known nothing of it, I would
have come to you.”</p>

<p>When I began to make preparations to leave
their village they held on to my dress and to my
arms, begging me not to leave them, with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
one to teach them about the Bible, and they
would not let me go. Finally I had to pull myself
from them and go for my train. As far
down the track as I could see, those dear
ones were waving and calling me to return
to them. Even now I can see those beckoning
hands and hear those voices calling, although I
am now far away in my homeland.</p>

<p>What? Shall they perish without knowing
of God’s great love and of His power and willingness
to bless them and lift them up from the
awful darkness of sin and idolatry which they
are in? I wish my readers might get a peep into
the land where the true God is unknown, and
where there are no Bibles to guide the people
into the right path, I am sure they would give,
and so help others, who have been called, to go.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
